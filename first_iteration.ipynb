semiconductor manufacturing company nyse tsm here are highlights from wednesday s analyst blog how are semiconductor companies doing this quarter semiconductor stocks have been mixed so far and a broader cyclical slowdown seems apparent from the results most players aren t expecting a protracted downturn mainly because the rollout is coming sooner than expected because auto content adds are continuing and other secular drivers like artificial intelligence ai and internet of things iot remain ongoing drivers additionally technology transition to smaller nodes is a positive for equipment companies the possibility of a u s china trade war remains a shadow for longer term prospects but this isn t a negative in the near term as it can only lead to inventory adds at customers read on for the details intelbarely topped expectations for the quarter helped by the client computing group iotg and mobileye f most disappointing was the weakness in data center where intel will also see market share loss to amd weak nand prices also didn t help the quarter guidance for the second quarter disappointed due to continued weakness in data center from softness in china to improve in the second half and weak gross margin from continued softness in nand pricing and the ramp first products with chips will be on the market this holiday season exiting the modem business that apple nasdaq aapl is now widely believed to have awarded qualcomm nasdaq qcom will help shave a billion dollars from operating cost numbers eps of topped the zacks consensus estimate of reported revenue of billion was

the second straight quarterly decline in what looks like a semiconductor down cycle management helpfully commented that historically semi down cycles were a four to five quarter affair after which year on year growth usually returned still as experts and analysts have been commenting on for long there remain several secular drivers for this industry for ti the silver lining was communications infrastructure where deployment led to growth the core auto and industrial markets where most of its resources are parked benefit from increasing content per unit although overall weakness is perceivable at this point its personal communications business is feeling the pain from a sluggish smartphone market especially lower than expected business from apple so net net the all important analog business that makes up of its revenue was down a moderate while embedded processing revenue share declined margins were of course impacted by the lower utilization rate that s despite the fact that ti outsources some stuff mainly in the embedded unit and cuts those outside orders before reducing production at internal fabs the company continues to return all of its fcf to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases numbers eps of topped the zacks consensus estimate of reported revenue of billion was higher than the zacks consensus estimate of billion the zacks consensus estimate for grew cents to in the last days the shares carry a zacks rank hold xilinx squarter was marred by weakness in the data center market expected to rebound next quarter as offset by driven strength in communications as well as a robust adas driven automotive business rollout in south korea and preparation for in china were salient features in the quarter accounting for the growth in the asia pacific management expects to grow content with which is also expected to be a much bigger market than the strength in the communications business however impacted margins higher tape out expenses are also associated with margin pressure but management expects the margin to normalize in the second half of the year as the end market mix normalizes numbers eps of missed the zacks

favorable tax rate and the benefit of ongoing share repurchases lower wfe spending in the mid to high teens percent range driven by inventory burn at nand and dram customers is expected to continue through the year this will be offset by strength at foundry and logic customers ramping leading edge nodes faster than expected foundry in particular was very strong in the last quarter overall lam is strongly positioned by virtue of its product range that facilitates technology conversion at the front end so the advent of ai and iot are expanding the served available market while strength in china which is now a billion market supports continued growth numbers eps of easily surpassed the zacks consensus estimate of reported revenue of billion was higher than the zacks consensus estimate of billion the zacks consensus estimate for grew to in the last days the shares carry a zacks rank hold taiwan semiconductor manufacturing companyreported a weak quarter as a global slowdown especially in smartphones consequent inventory buildup at customers and a photoresist contamination at one of its fabs combined to pull down results u s china trade war related concerns was likely an offsetting factor as it would normally cause chinese customers to stock pile what follows from the above situation is a reduction in utilization which along with low margins impacts profitability note that the contaminated product will ship this quarter helping numbers also full year gross margin guidance of was reiterated as tsm expects strong utilization in the second half but the main question for investors is the extent of the slowdown and the factors that will play a role in pulling it out management said that channel inventories will largely be burnt down especially at important customers like nvidia nasdaq nvda by the middle of the year which makes for a stronger second half so hpc ai will come back soon the sooner than expected rollout in asia and apple s truce with qualcomm that will further boost adoption makes another strong driver of growth iot and automotive applications are other expected drivers tsm snatched the process lead from intel and is already working on and while shipping and in volume this makes it the go to place for fabless semiconductor players the capex target is being maintained at billion so the company will spend as necessary to maintain its process lead its client roster includes companies like nvidia apple qualcomm and amd that are all at the leading edge of technology all except amd are also market leaders this positions it very well to benefit from any semiconductor upcycle it also positions it to benefit from their new product rollouts this is especially true because of the cyclical slowdown in semiconductors which could extend for quarters more so new products from customers and shipping to consumption are important factors likely to help tsm numbers the zacks consensus estimate for remains unchanged at after it was lowered

members growing to million international growth was even stronger at up to million but since content costs whether acquired or produced continue to increase the earnings of cents fell below the zacks

more lam research semiconductor equipment maker lam research saw very strong growth in revenue and earnings both of which also sailed past the respective zacks consensus estimates that s because the semiconductor market is particularly hot right now as players scramble to produce more memory to capture the growing demand for data and related services the company estimates that the semiconductor

alignment of these critical business functions legal regulatory apple fined million after years of winning and losing appeals virnetx which sues on patents held but doesn t manufacture anything of its own has finally won another legal round against apple the judge and jury found apple guilty of infringement and willful infringement at that so they awarded the patent troll as such companies are sometimes called million this includes the jury verdict of million awarded last year additional willful infringement charges of million or in royalties per infringed device sold and another million by way of interests costs and attorney fees apple said it would appeal the decision qualcomm nasdaq qcom sues apple again an accesswire report indicates that qualcomm has filed another patent infringement case against apple in beijing the three patents in question are related to power management and touch screen technology known as force touch which apple uses in its iphones qualcomm says that since these patents are not a part of any standard it is not bound to license them qualcomm is asking the court to ban the manufacture and sale of iphones in china since this is an employment question it is very unlikely that the lawsuit will be successful the chinese authorities haven t made the filing public yet apple hasn t denied infringement but instead called the suit a courtroom maneuver adding that these patents have never been discussed in the past and that qualcomm s effort would fail new products technology apple watch connectivity issue in china the new apple watch was the first one offering cellular connectivity by virtue of an esim subscriber identity module that apple has embedded in it the problem is that in china the sim is normally provided by state owned telecom companies which also register the person s name this therefore made it possible for the government to identify the person using it connectivity was first made available exclusively to customers on china unicom but was abruptly cut off without adequate explanations all that china unicom said on its website was that the cellular feature had been offered on a trial basis it s currently believed that since the technology is relatively new and lesser known in china regulatory authorities may have required its discontinuation iphone demand issue taiwan s economic daily reported that apple told its suppliers of a cut in iphone components for the final quarter of the year because of lower than expected demand this is likely because of customers are waiting it out to buy the more expensive iphone x although there could be some customers defecting to other devices if iphone x increases in the sales mix apple will obviously make more profit so this weakness could in fact be good news nevertheless it sent shares down intel nasdaq intc on autonomous vehicle safety intel and mobileye otc mbbyf have created a set of standards that if adopted will ensure that self

for video makers with at least followers it also introduced a new video format for semi immersive videos that is intended to reduce the cost of creation google chip for consumer devices last week google announced a system on chip soc called pixel visual core that will increase the speed and power efficiency of its camera google says it s an image processing unit ipu although it is structurally closer to an core processor like qualcomm s snapdragon or samsung ks exynos although a part of its latest pixel offerings google will activate the device some time soon after which third party developers will get access to it google hasn t said that its relationship with qualcomm will change as a result of the chip but its growing prowess in chip design is no doubt a matter of concern for the leading mobile processor company for google this is an important step to more closely integrate hardware and software in its devices the way that apple does if anything these moves are indication of google s growing ambitions for mobile and iot markets new twitter rules for abuse hate speech twitter hasn t formed any new rules but the company has come out and said that it s going to its primary goal is to remove unwanted sexual advances nonconsensual nudity hate symbols violent groups and tweets that glorify violence from the platform and it will frame rules so bystanders can report incidents twitter will take enforcement action against organizations that use have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause the concession comes after rose mcgowan was prevented from posting additional tweets about alleged sexual abuse by hollywood bigwigs twitter said that the hour suspension was because she mentioned a private phone number women boycotted the site on her call this kind of thing is turning out to be unsafe for users and therefore harmful for business so the company says it is taking necessary steps collaborations and m a apple ge deal apple has inked a deal with ge to use its predix data collection and analysis tool to launch a toolkit targeted at the industrial sector the toolkit will help developers build apps for iphone and ipads that can facilitate collaboration in industrial environments thus increasing the efficiency of operations lowering unplanned downtime facilitating better resource allocation and leading to overall time and cost savings apple s role will thus be to develop and promote predix as the industrial iot platform of choice for which ge will standardize on iphone and ipad and promote apple s mac computers as a choice for its global workforce of more than employees apple s approach has been to build custom solutions for large enterprises and verticals with each win being a stepping stone helping it expand deeper into the enterprise segment intel facebook on ai chip intel announced its nervana neural network processors at the wsj d live conference last week the chip has been built specifically for neural networks and is according to intel a first of its kind intel intends to expand the product line to an entire family over time former nervana ceo naveen rao who joined intel after his company was acquired by the chip giant said that intel would ultimately sell the chips in two ways it will either sell a data center appliance containing several of the new nervana neural network processors as well as intel s cpus to customers wanting to run deep learning projects within their own data centers or it will rent access to the chips through intel s cloud data centers the way nvidia does facebook nasdaq fb which along with others helped the chip get off to launch will be among the first to test the chip on its platform facebook buys tbh facebook has bought tbh or to be honest the anonymous messaging app from parent company midnight labs the app allows you to run polls regarding people s positive attributes after which there is an option to connect with the people that chose

with food delivery services like grubhub eatstreet delivery com doordash chownow and olo and direct deals with some restaurants that will allow u s users to order food from within the app facebook says food delivery is a tricky business and promises to remove some of the hurdles in its operation the goal is of course that users never leave its platform by giving them all they might need right on it the longer they stay the greater the opportunities to serve them ads and keep them from rival services like google in the delivery business too operations like ubereats and amazon delivery are likely to see increased competition because of facebook cisco buying perspica cisco is building on its billion acquisition of appdynamics which offers tools to better understand how applications are operating to identify which applications or hardware are not providing optimal performance now perspica a machine learning startup that has raised around million will expand and strengthen these capabilities so customers can better analyze large amounts of application related data in real time and with business context and irrespective of when an application is deployed in a company s public

the google express delivery service in new york city the company has announced that it will be expanding it to the rest of the country barring hawaii and alaska so customers can use the google express website or app to get their target stuff delivered what s more target is quickly bringing more services to google express including its redcard credit and debit cards that enable free shipping and a discount this one should be available next year although voice ordering hasn t gained momentum and most people aren t comfortable using it yet the deal also lets target customers voice order through google home for google this is valuable data that gives it insight into customer buying habits and so can help it better target ads it also provides it a foothold in the product search space that

four weeks and on the year despite the climb which easily tops its market s average nvda rests roughly below its october highs this could give nvidia stock solid room to run as part of what is projected to be a return to top and bottom line growth across the semiconductor industry in after a rough last quarter fiscal marked the fourth straight period that the gpu giant posted declining sales and earnings nvidia over the last year was negatively impacted by the cyclical nature of the chip space and its own outsized success looking ahead nvidia expects to remain a key player in the high end video game industry nvidia under the leadership of ceo jensen huang also expects to expand its reach in data centers which are integral in our cloud age along with ai iot autonomous driving

figure is projected to jump higher on the back of higher sales to reach billion investors should note that both of these figures would easily surpass nvidia s performance nvidia is a zacks rank buy at the moment based on its strong fiscal and earnings revision activity the stock also rocks a b grade for growth and is part of an industry that sits in the top of our over zacks industries nvda also

on alibaba nyse baba here is a synopsis of all three stocks i last wrote about nvidia as the bull of the day in mid november after another strong quarterly report instead of sustaining new highs above shares fell nearly to support under as the semiconductor group acquiesced to extremely overbought conditions and this despite analysts raising nvda s eps estimates from a consensus to with several high end projections near still at that would make nvda trade at times the most optimistic forward estimates and so nervous holders with any profits are quick to run on any excuse we saw that excuse as a great opportunity in early december to add more nvda shares in my portfolio here s what i told my members on december about a potentially fading opportunity to still buy nvda near as i ve written numerous times this is the one to own for ai engines and advanced hpc high performance computing applications nvidia builds systems on a chip soc that are fueling so many different bleeding edge industries from autonomous driving robotics and big data mining to cancer genomic research medical diagnosis and cyber security that all require massively parallel architecture mpa and as the nvidia press page reminds us this week the year in tech wakes up early with the annual international consumer electronics show ces in las vegas on sunday january at when nvidia founder and ceo jensen huang takes the stage to talk about the company s automotive platforms as always we can also expect a flurry of related surprises from nvidia to explain the long tail of nvidia s growth and dominance within and connected to several technology industries let s review what i wrote in mid november is nvda too expensive at but many investors wonder if the stock is still a buy as it now trades for times trailing month earnings as an nvda investor i have a bias that says yes i would still be a buyer near and after this most recent quarterly report as i go over the growth profile in all its different business segments and customers i find multiple reasons to reinforce this view in sum as long as the leading provider of gaming processors high performance computing in data centers and emerging ai technologies keeps delivering solid double digit sales and earnings growth along with upside surprises each quarter then paying times the current projection for next year s profits isn t a bad proposition so two important questions follow will the market demand for hpc ai solutions in data center gaming and automotive segments continue to grow at high double digits can nvidia maintain their dominant position even as intel nasdaq intc buys mobileye otc mbbyf for a foothold in driverless cars and forges a renewed alliance with old arch enemy advanced micro devices nasdaq amd to establish a front in gpu processor markets to help you decide whether the current multiple is too expensive for nvidia s growth this article will go over the current and forecast leadership of nvidia and why some wall street investment banks believe the company is on its way to earning per share in which would equate to a multiple at high street targets near every major dude will tell youin early november i was reviewing all the big announcements at the beijing gpu tech conference in late september in particular that the giants of china e commerce alibaba baidu and tencent were all new cloud datacenter customers i came away with the insight that everybody is their customer now then on monday november from the supercomputing conference in denver nvidia issued a press release highlighting the exact thing nvidia chosen by every major computer maker every major clouddenver nov globe newswire nvidia today announced the world s most advanced data center gpu the nvidia tesla nasdaq tsla gpu based on nvidia s volta architecture is available through every major computer maker and chosen by every major cloud to deliver artificial intelligence and high performance computing dell emc nyse emc hewlett packard enterprise huawei ibm nyse ibm and lenovo have all announced volta based offerings for their customers providers such as alibaba cloud amazon nasdaq amzn web services baidu cloud microsoft nasdaq msft azure oracle nyse orcl cloud and tencent cloud have also announced volta based cloud services building on this breadth of offerings nvidia has introduced new software and tools on the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry that make it easy for scientists to deploy nvidia s accelerated computing platform for compute intensive research end of nvidia press release excerpt while i really like the fact that some of my favorite cloud builders and ai innovators like alibaba and baidu are nvidia customers i am even more impressed that amazon and microsoft are let s explore why volta is nvidia s latest advance in hpc architecture it delivers over teraflops per second tflops of deep learning performance over a increase compared to the prior generation nvidia pascal architecture it s important to understand that nvidia doesn t just make hpc parallel processing chips for gaming datacenter ai and other applications the gpu chips with thousands of cores come embedded in some version of an overall platform known as cuda compute unified device architecture which allows developers to immediately begin programming in a common language say c what they want the machine learning system to do so the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry adds a new level of service and ease of use for corporations applying the technology in short nvidia has just outdone themselves again in winning over the developer and enterprise communities by creating an extended platform which simplifies software integrations deep learning is nvidia s businessstick with me on mapping who nvidia s customers are and just as importantly why they are if you understand this end demand for the technology from the who s who of big tech companies you will better appreciate the potential value of nvidia s growth segments and the coming explosion of ai applications that i am going to describe for you in the last two sections so how does nvidia speak to both individual developers and massive enterprises after they build a cuda architecture they make sure that data scientists entrepreneurs and organizations can use it in may the company announced that their deep learning institute was expanding the number and availability of programming courses at little or no cost with the goal of training developers by the end of and on october nvidia announced immediate availability of the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry for ai developers worldwide here was the word from that pr in just a few steps ngc helps developers get started with deep learning development through no cost access to a comprehensive easy to use fully optimized deep learning software stack the cloud based service is available immediately to users of the just announced amazon elastic compute cloud amazon instances featuring nvidia tesla gpus nvidia plans to expand support to other cloud platforms soon after signing up for an ngc account developers can download a containerized software stack that integrates and optimizes a wide range of deep learning frameworks nvidia libraries and cuda runtime versions which are kept up to date and run seamlessly in the cloud or on nvidia dgx systems the nvidia gpu cloud democratizes ai for a rapidly expanding global base of users said jim mchugh vice president and general manager of enterprise systems at nvidia ngc frees developers from the complexity of integration allowing them to move quickly to create sophisticated neural networks that deliver the transformative powers of ai end of nvda pr excerpt from oct also at the supercomputing conference in denver where dozens of computer makers and cloud service providers launched a wide range of volta based products and services ceo and nvidia founder jensen huang proudly described what he must regard as their greatest overall achievement volta is the world s most powerful platform for ai and hpc and will allow the world s top minds in scientific research to push the limit on what s possible in areas like drug discovery alternative fuel sources and predicting natural disasters with volta now in data centers and clouds around the world a new wave of innovation is underway that will have an incredible impact across society with every major computer and cloud provider adopting nvidia technology the runway appears clear for continued sales growth over the next years how far will segment growth fly before i break down nvidia s segment growth let me share a few important notes on terminology inference is the term used to describe the next level of machine learning after training inference is sometimes referred to as deep learning after scientists have trained a system on data then they can have it apply the data set and knowledge to learn new things think of the initial training as establishing weights for data baselines and inference as advanced pattern recognition gaming is still nvidia s biggest end market claiming nearly of the company s projected billion in sales this year and still growing at over annually and gaming is still the largest global entertainment industry at over billion in annual sales in september i read several investment bank research reports which indicated that nvidia could continue to grow their cloud datacenter business at over annually for the next years with sales projections ranging from to billion in just for this segment results delivered confirmation of that optimism with volta adoption driving datacenter segment sales to million representing sequential quarter over quarter and annual year over year growth nvda noted that there are now more than companies using its volta based inference platform and this is why many wall street analysts are so enthusiastic about the continued growth in the datacenter space especially since the total addressable market tam is expected to push over billion in the next to years automotive is currently a small sales contributor for nvidia at just under of total revenues but the segment is growing at nearly as nvidia forms key partnerships in europe with bosch and paccar nasdaq pcar and in china with baidu to deliver autonomous driving

earnings might grow a little in but are in danger of falling in see more below with the economy only growing slightly and earnings looking decent but not strong it s hard to see many new positive

sales on thursday and housing starts and building permits on friday it s shaping up to be a big week from the perspective of consumer health which drives so much of the economy the data could be worth watching more closely than usual simply because the market is on edge about the fed s next move if the numbers on retail sales and housing look strong it could play into thoughts that the fed might not want to get too aggressive lowering rates further it could be another example of good news being bad weekly jobless claims on thursday were better than expected another possible signal of economic

s going to be interesting to see if it can stay that way if bonds start rallying again speaking of which both gold and bonds recovered some territory late thursday from earlier lows that could reinforce feelings that we re far from out of the woods which is true enough one thing to consider watching today is whether investors feel they can enter the weekend without taking some of thursday s

closed below in nearly a year or above in more than two years however the dollar remains more robust than many people might have gotten used to during the era when it mostly traded below so today s levels might seem challenging to companies selling products overseas you d think the dollar might come under more pressure due to expectations for fed rate cuts but with central banks around the world

time of year when those scary tuition bills could appear in the mail any day or maybe they have already and they re sitting on the counter waiting for you to open them some investors might be at the

of winter fall in parts of the country friday the stock market also has a chilly tone to start the day concerns about rising rates continue to weigh on sentiment and so does a higher than expected read on u s inflation some investors seem to be seizing on what looked like an unremarkable aspect of the fed s statement yesterday one that was unchanged from the previous meeting the fed said it expects further gradual increases in rates as the economy continues to thrive it s a bit hard to understand any panic about these words because they didn t tell investors anything that most didn t already know still perhaps some people had hoped for a more dovish tone after october s market thrashing and the fed didn t deliver as it is markets fell across europe and asia overnight and pressure might spill over into u s trading speaking of europe there s more drama there as the european commission tangled with italy over the italian government s budget forecasts which the ec said looked too optimistic on deficits moving west debate raged about whether a brexit deal might be getting close and the u k government is holding meetings on the issue this weekend media reports said a brexit breakthrough if it comes might give european markets a boost but it s unclear how close it might be asian markets are on pace to fall for the sixth week out of the last seven back home a slew of fed speakers march out to the microphones today so consider watching for some of their reflections michigan sentiment is also due this morning additionally in a report that might keep the fed on its toes producer prices shot up by in october the biggest monthly climb in six years and way above analyst estimates of higher gas machinery and equipment prices all played a part however it s important to note that core wholesale inflation which strips out volatile energy and food prices rose a little less at and prices over the last year are up below the peak seen last summer with oil now in a tailspin see more below inflationary worries might be lifting in earnings news late thursday disney nyse dis delivered a strong quarter posting earnings per share of and revenue of billion third party consensus was for and billion both parks and resorts and the company s studio entertainment segments performed well and the company predicted an accelerated timeline for its takeover of major assets of century fox inc nasdaq fox according to dis the acquisition could close meaningfully earlier than the mid date it had previously projected the wall street journal reported shares of dis climbed in pre market trading the news didn t look so hot over at activision blizzard nasdaq atvi where shares crumbled in the pre market hours after the company missed analysts earnings expectations and saw active users fall fed reflection thursday saw stocks move a bit lower as the fed held rates steady some of the pressure also might have reflected profit taking after a massive rally wednesday that possibly got a bit overdone also the fed stuck to its position of advocating gradual rate hikes meaning no sign of any end to the steady drip drip of higher rates this is the part that seems to be hurting sentiment early friday the fed s decision likely didn t come as a surprise to many but futures prices still predict around a chance of a fourth rate hike by the end of the year fed chair jerome powell is scheduled to make some public comments next week which could give investors more insight into the fed s current thinking the fed s statement thursday didn t evolve much from its last meeting in september as it did then the fed noted economic activity has been rising at a strong rate and job gains have been strong it added that the unemployment rate has dropped and that household spending has continued to grow strongly fed sees business investment moderating the one significant change was around business investment and that follows what looked like a slowdown in that category in the gross domestic product gdp report issued last month growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year the fed s statement now reads back in september the fed s statement said that the category had grown strongly on the inflation front there was no change to the fed s september prediction that price increases would remain near its target over the next months both for overall inflation and core inflation that strips out food and energy prices the fed arguably finds itself in a tough place as it tries to keep the u s economy from overheating even as it faces pressure not to run the value of the dollar so high through tighter monetary policy that it might hurt foreign countries and keep their consumers from being able to afford u s products remember the fed has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment there are signs that a stronger dollar along with recent trade battles might be hurting u s company outlooks in treasuries the year benchmark yield rose slightly to after the fed statement thursday just a few basis points below last month s highs it was at early friday energy loses steam after oil craters energy shares took the biggest hit thursday falling more than as crude oil entered a bear market see more below the dollar index is also back on the climb moving above thursday after falling below earlier this week hawkish fed policy tends to support a strong dollar and that could be a possible stress factor for some sectors like tech industrials and materials with big foreign markets also the dollar is once again climbing vs the chinese yuan with the psychological yuan to the dollar level not far away financials did appear to get a boost from the fed s continued optimistic tone regarding the economy and topped the sector leaderboard thursday in fact financials are outpacing the broader s p index spx over the last week that s kind of a change of pace but it s not clear if it can hold up bank stocks have declined about so far this year and just haven t been able to get going despite this anticipated higher rate environment the stock market is out of correction but the crude market turned bearish thursday u s futures closed below a barrel on thursday down more than from highs above last month generally a drop from high close to low close defines a bear market by early friday the front month u s contract had fallen to the first time a front month has fallen under since march there hasn t been a close below in nearly nine months so perhaps that s worth watching later today thursday s losses were the ninth consecutive lower session for u s crude futures with oil taking a beating from u s production hitting record highs and saudi arabia and russia also gearing up output the long term impact on the energy sector from all this is too soon to tell one bad month probably isn t going to make that big a difference but extended periods of low oil prices can sometimes hinder energy sector earnings growth as investors might remember from the bear oil market of at that point crude fell as low as a barrel in the u s and many oil companies saw dramatic plunges in their earnings it s way too soon to worry about that now and it s also unlikely crude could fall to such bargain basement levels especially considering how healthy the u s economy is now compared to then figure extra cash for holiday shoppers this one month chart comparing the consumer discretionary sector candlestick to the energy sector purple line shows that discretionary stocks are starting to rally back from october lows even as energy continues to wallow near recent lows cheaper oil is hurting the energy sector but might end up helping discretionary by putting a little extra gas savings in holiday shoppers pockets data source s p dow jones indices chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results lower gas costs might help shoppers consumer discretionary has had its rally hat on lately ahead of holiday shopping season and gas prices going back below a gallon across much of the country over the last week probably can t hurt this sector lower gas prices might have a psychological impact making shoppers feel like they can spend a bit more on gifts if they re saving at the pump see chart above stay tuned this weekend for an opec meeting some analysts think opec members might start sending signals soon about lowering output in the face of this price pullback but that s not assured others say saudi arabia may be under political pressure to keep the oil flowing after last month s diplomatic dispute with the u s over a missing journalist tech recovery beyond the headlines the faangs get a lot of attention and all five of those closely watched stocks are up significantly from their october lows some have even gained in the double digits however if you re looking for the best performing tech stocks since october s depths you won t find the faangs among them instead tech leaders as of thursday afternoon included semiconductor firm advanced micro devices nasdaq amd up from its october low followed by a gain from cybersecurity company symantec nasdaq symc and a rise from xilinx nasdaq xlnx a supplier of programmable logic devices cnbc noted what this might help show is how varied the tech sector is beyond big names like apple nasdaq aapl ibm nyse ibm and microsoft nasdaq msft from a high level view tech still trails the broader s p spx over the last month this partly reflects how so much selling zeroed in on tech shares during october s shakeout for the year so far tech shares are still up more than compared with less than for the spx but tech s rise this year is way short of the better than gains of consider keeping an eye out for a couple of major tech earnings next week from cisco nasdaq csco and nvidia nasdaq nvda which could give insight into the latest macro developments in those two companies respective industries retail stocks perk up ahead of holidays earnings black friday is just two weeks away less if you factor in that many stores actually throw open the doors late on thanksgiving and retail earnings season is also fast approaching next week brings home depot nyse hd and macy s nyse m along with walmart nyse wmt nordstrom nyse jwn and jc penney nyse jcp so what do investors seem to think about how holiday shopping season might shape up judging from company share performance the answer seems to be a thumbs up many big retailers have been outpacing the broader s p spx since posting their october lows as of midday thursday macy s shares were up since the recent low last month amazon nasdaq amzn was up and kohl s nyse kss was up wmt didn t seem to be affected much by the market sell off in october and is up over the last month the spx is up about from its october low on the whole consumer discretionary stocks are slightly outpacing the spx since early october the outlier might be apple nasdaq aapl which is actually a tech stock but obviously can have a huge impact on shopping season the stock has made it back a bit after falling below a share last week but remains a long way from recent highs of around as investors continue to debate what the company s holiday quarter guidance and decision to stop reporting iphone unit sales might mean moving forward td ameritrade commentary for educational purposes only member sipc options involve risks and are not suitable for all investors please read characteristics and risks of standardized options', 'friday market open the u s jobs machine kept humming along in october despite a soft stock market creating jobs to far exceed wall street analysts expectations at the same time hourly pay rose the biggest jump in almost a decade and one that could conceivably bring inflation fears back into play this looks like another great jobs report the gain in payrolls easily surpassed the average estimate heading into the report while the pay gains met expectations the labor department also made some minor revisions to past jobs reports lowering september s gain to from but raising august growth to a massive the unemployment rate stayed unchanged in october at a near year low of the hourly wage increase of compared with recent gains of just below so on its face it s not a huge change but investors sometimes pay more attention to big round numbers so there could be a psychological effect to seeing the increase rise above earlier this year a rise sent some investors scurrying for cover amid concerns that higher wages might throw the market into a wage price inflationary cycle that could bring the fed in to clamp down on any possible overheating the same concerns might start creeping in now and chances of a fed rate hike by the end of the year inched higher soon after the data right after friday s report the major indices appeared to hold close to where they d been a few minutes before in pre market trading with the dow jones industrial average dji still pointing to possible point gains after the open in part on optimism about china trade see more below while nasdaq composite comp slumped slightly in part due to disappointment over apple s nasdaq aapl results see more below looking a little deeper into the data leisure and hospitality added the most jobs with and healthcare added but manufacturing and construction which tend to be hallmarks of a booming economy also posted solid gains of and respectively other areas with decent gains included transportation and warehousing and business and professional services it s hard to find anything wrong with this report which showed job creation rising for the consecutive month and continued stellar numbers out of the health care sector the only place where things might have gotten a little overblown was leisure and hospitality which may have seen some pent up demand due to the hurricane earlier this fall under the peel apple earnings as always had the potential to either slow the market s momentum or help put more wind at its back this time the company s results seemed to bring some bears out of the woods as shares sank more than in pre market trading if this holds up it would be the biggest single day decline in aapl shares in more than two years in a nutshell apple s results were certainly not a disaster the quarter had its low and high points but investors seemed to focus at least initially on the disappointing ones though aapl beat third party consensus estimates for both earnings per share and revenue iphone unit sales of million were a bit shy of wall street s estimates the average selling prices for the iphone on the other hand rose to up from the previous quarter and beating factset s estimate of around disappointment seemed to center on the iphone unit sales number and the company s fiscal guidance of billion to billion which was just below the average analyst estimate of billion looking at things from a high level the average selling price gain could be seen as healthy because it might send the message that aapl s higher priced phones are gaining traction with its customer base however the miss on iphone unit sales could indicate that people are waiting longer to replace their old phones not such a good development as for the guidance aapl has often been conservative on its guidance but some investors might have wanted to see aapl projecting a blowout holiday quarter especially after the disappointing holiday quarter guidance from amazon nasdaq amzn last week it also may disappoint some investors to hear that aapl won t break out iphone unit volume in its earnings any more the street doesn t tend to like when companies cut back on what investors see as an important number for guidance lots of companies don t report product unit sales but the iphone arguably isn t just any product china fortunes keep swaying market to get a sense of just how large u s china trade issues loom going into the meeting between the country s leaders later this month consider the action in stocks thursday morning things were chugging along a little higher before a tweet from president trump in which he said he d had a productive conversation with chinese president xi the dji quickly scampered to point gains even though the tweet lacked much detail then early friday stock futures jumped to more big gains after what sounded like encouraging words from president xi on state television according to media reports the point gain in djia futures seemed to come based just on the two leaders comments with no details offered about what kind of agreement might be in store or when it could be reached those gains got pared in the hour ahead of the opening bell after cnbc reported an administration official saying there s a long way to go to reach a deal stocks overseas particularly in asia had risen overnight in part on the trade rumored detente xi and trump are scheduled to meet at the group of buenos aires summit nov dec so investors might want to consider staying tuned for any previews of that the threat of u s tariffs on an additional billion in chinese goods could be one factor that continues to keep the market slightly in check until investors have a better sense of whether these trade issues can get resolved recent economic data from china have been mixed and the u s administration says nothing is set in stone on whether those additional tariffs will take effect media reports said to sum up there s probably no issue right now as close to the minds of most investors as trade with china even the u s midterms arguably don t seem to have as much force this remains one reason why it s probably safe to say that volatility doesn t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon three in a row before aapl and payrolls the stock market posted its third straight day of healthy gains thursday the dow jones industrial average dji has gained points over this stretch the comeback which took the major indices out of correction could be evidence that the sell off probably didn t reflect panic except for a frantic minutes before the close one day last week but instead might have been many people taking profits and maybe looking for their next opportunity pretty much everything moved in an orderly way downward except for that one afternoon and the orderly selling and the quick snap back this week could indicate that people in general didn t give up on the market however a word of caution this rally has been very quick and the markets aren t far now from where they were when all this craziness started for long term investors it s arguably more important than ever to have a plan and stick to it before buying a company at what might look like a bargain price consider asking yourself if the company s fundamentals have changed and whether buying its shares fit into your plan going forward these are weeks when it can really help to have a game plan and not get sucked in by the minute to minute fluctuations crude leaks to seven month lows meanwhile crude got hammered with u s futures hitting their lowest level since april on thursday to close at a barrel that s down from above a month ago climbing u s stockpiles and rising production from saudi arabia and russia all could be playing into this and demand fears amid widespread declines in world stock markets also could be a factor in other commodity news gold moved higher thursday perhaps because some investors see it as an inflation hedge the gold rally aligned with the dollar pulling back from recent yearly highs perhaps in part because some investors seem to have started to reverse the risk off attitude they d taken as stocks plunged last month over in the data department october u s auto sales drifted in throughout thursday from various companies with fiat chrysler nyse fcau enjoying a strong resurgence and toyota reporting slight gains but ford nyse f reporting a drop from a year earlier one thing that seemed pretty clear looking across the spectrum was continued strength in the suv market but falling demand for sedans in other earnings news after the close kraft heinz nasdaq khc shares plunged in post market trading after the company missed wall street analysts earnings estimate while starbucks nasdaq sbux shares steamed higher after beating estimates before friday s open exxon mobil nyse xom shares rose on solid earnings for the huge energy company figure dollar dozes after a steady ride higher over the last couple of weeks that took it to new highs for the year above the dollar index retreated the last two days perhaps in part because some investors started to cut back on their risk off pose adopted during the stock market sell off gold purple line initially weakened this week as the dollar kept climbing but might have gotten a boost thursday from the dollar s struggles and as investors could be looking to hedge inflation data sources ice nyse ice cme group nasdaq cme chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results getting things done more good economic tidings this week came in the form of improved u s productivity in productivity rose the government said and productivity was upwardly revised to that s quite a jump from the anemic growth in and which essentially was zero generally improved productivity tends to characterize a quicker growing more dynamic

helped lead to rapid growth it s really tailed off since then and now a quarter with like looks very strong compared with trend which has been barely above the last few years the uptick in productivity was the result of output increasing and hours worked increasing briefing com noted what might help push productivity into a prolonged upswing one analyst on cnbc suggested thursday that

rallied back from the recent low mark posted monday while amd have come back since that same day the chip makers originally started to sag amid fears of possible declining demand and potential tariff impacts those issues haven t necessarily gone away but it does show the kind of impact geopolitical fears can have on sectors like this one this time the fear might have gotten a bit overdone don t forget the fed with all the ruckus this morning about employment it s easy to forget that there s a fed meeting next week at this point the futures market projects about a chance of the fed leaving rates alone at this particular meeting but an chance that rates will go up by the end of the year one interesting note is that this is going to be the last fed meeting without an accompanying press conference the fed announced earlier this year that there would be a press conference at every meeting starting in as always next week s meeting will be followed by a statement in its last statement

iphone manufacturing in the u s in june this year apple requested its iphone assemblers pegatron and foxconn to evaluate the feasibility of making the devices in the u s while pegatron refused outright on cost considerations foxconn has decided to do the job the study is likely to show that the cost increase skill mismatch and supply chain problems the supply chain is largely in asia would make this cost prohibitive this would raise iphone prices for consumers squeeze apple s margins but the study will help apple negotiate with the government which might agree to fund skill development and or subsidize u s made phones if not apple could introduce a luxury line of iphones manufactured in the u s and try to set off the super normal profits on those with the increased cost of phones carrying the government import duty note that apple is not the only smartphone maker saddled with the problem so if all smartphones get more expensive apple s market share may not be affected cisco earnings report cisco s first quarter results on both the top and bottom lines but the guidance disappointed switching remains a sore point for cisco in a market increasingly favoring sdn networks and leveraging the cloud so it s not surprising that this segment declined the company had greater success in security where both advanced threat up and web security up were strong intel a i day at its first artificial intelligence ai day in san francisco last week intel announced bold plans to target the deep learning segment that is currently dominated by nvidia nasdaq nvda gpus intel silicon is also in the mix but it doesn t take part in the real training work artificial intelligence comprises two main operations training and inference with training being the more compute intensive inference can be handled by intel cpus xilinx altera fpgas nvidia gpus asics like google nasdaq googl tpu and in some cases dsps now intel is planning to enter the training side very aggressively and hopefully it can stick with the timeline it has set based on its acquisition of startup nervana last year intel is building a new xeon processor with nervana integration fpgas are generally used as accelerators and we don t know yet if intel will be using the fpga technology it got through nervana or altera which it also picked up recently at any rate intel promises to deliver the training speed current gpus offer within three years which industry expert patrick moorhead says is aggressive intel expects the chips to start testing in mid and ship by year end fake news drama facebook nasdaq fb and google are being pressured by mainstream media msm for influencing the public in favor of trump as ridiculous as this sounds there is a lot of print devoted to trying to prove them guilty google recently started employing artificial intelligence to support its search results that have until now been solely algorithm based but as luck would have it there was a brief period during which time wordpress com took the top position fielding incorrect data on the number of votes earned by clinton and trump and claiming to have obtained the information from twitter the information was reportedly correct elsewhere on google but this was enough to earn google accusations for making money out of fake news so google has said in a statement moving forward we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent misstate or conceal information about the publisher the publisher s content or the primary purpose of the web property it is hoped that the inability to generate revenue from fake news will make it harder to produce it facebook s mark zuckerberg has repeatedly said that of the news sites posting on facebook were authentic and that it didn t want to get into the position of arbiter of truth we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal misleading or deceptive which includes fake news said the facebook statement the company has now added

apple call logs russian provider of iphone hacking tools elcomsoft says that apple maintains a call log of users phone calls and other details in its icloud for up to four months apple likely does this to help sync calls across devices but the storage of private information without explicit consent is problematic moreover in its data access guide for law enforcement apple says that available icloud information includes email logs and content text messages photos documents contacts calendars bookmarks and ios device backups but doesn t mention call logs while all icloud data is encrypted once it s on the server and in transit apple keeps the keys for icloud accounts in its u s data centers amazon nasdaq amzn sues counterfeit sellers following repeated complaints from different parties including apple amazon is taking action against companies acting as counterfeiters last week amazon filed a couple of cases against sellers of training equipment originally developed and patented by fitness anywhere and sold by third parties and against infringers of patented technology for forklift equipment these actions aren t easy because first the patent holder has to be established second new counterfeiters crop up all the time and third amazon given its size has millions of sellers so it s hard to track any one seller so these actions are encouraging amazon s chinese rival alibaba also faces the same problem resulting in the alienation of some brands new technology products apple considering ar device bloomberg reports that apple may be experimenting with a google s glass like ar augmented reality device for which it has spoken to suppliers and ordered a small quantity of related components but while google samsung ks facebook and others have focused more on vr virtual reality apple like microsoft with its hololens seems to be more interested in ar in any event the device is not expected to launch until at the earliest whatsapp video calling facebook has launched fully encrypted free video calling for all whatsapp users across the world while this obviously sweetens personal communications it also makes the app more attractive for business users the recently talked about job posting feature does the same thing facebook had promised to look at monetizing the app once the user base reached critical mass and the company seems to be doing just that amazon family plan similar to apple spotify and others amazon has launched a family plan that charges a month for up to six users prime members aren t getting a concession on this one although they do have the option of choosing an annual family membership for which then brings down the monthly cost to while other music services offer unique experiences feature sets personalized playlists and

driving and other technology connectivity communication context awareness deep learning artificial intelligence safety and security for cars all over the world intel has said that it is currently involved in vehicle programs but that number would swell to by its order book is already pretty huge at a billion dollars but this is just the beginning intel and google get closer google and intel are deepening their relationship with the goal of pushing their respective technologies in the cloud while google needs to wrest share versus amazon and microsoft intel would like to make inroads into the deep learning segment that nvidia dominates the two companies have now decided to go for both product integration and joint marketing to push these efforts especially among big cloud customers they have announced that the collaboration will include container management machine learning iot and security microsoft nvidia tie for a i the companies have announced a collaborative effort to promote microsoft s a i solution through its azure cloud computing platform the microsoft solution is based on gpus from nvidia the leading provider in the machine learning space indicating the considerable prospects the companies say that a i has application across a broad number of industries including healthcare life sciences energy financial services and automotive microsoft ties with elon musk a i company tesla s elon musk has agreed to use microsoft s azure to develop ai technology for its self driving cars the musk backed startup openai will use nvidia powered azure n series virtual machines which will be available from december openai was formed in december last year by musk and y combinator president sam altman and others with the goal of ascertaining that self driving technology remains open and free for all possibly also as a reaction to google s dominance in smartphones amazon hyundai hyundai s connected car blue link technology is now getting alexa integration so users can get their cars warmed up and ready before they step into them or they can ask alexa to lock the doors as they carry heavy grocery bags into the house google amd google is one company that

western digital nasdaq wdc making peace with toshiba were the top news from last week here are the details apple buys shazam apple has acquired popular music discovery app shazam for an estimated million shazam identifies music playing near the device within a few seconds and directs users to places like apple s app store or google s play store where they can listen to the whole track later but despite the billion times the app has been downloaded the company hasn t been able to monetize its service well which is probably why it is going this cheap it has raised a total of million in funding rounds the latest of which back in valued the company at billion in it generated around million in revenue to net a pre tax loss of million apple may be expected to integrate the software into apple music or siri or in homepod its new high end smart speaker boasting superior sound quality that will launch in it s unlikely that the service will be available to android users as well as it is now apple offers million to finisar finisar has obtained a million funding from cupertino based apple that it will use to re open a long shuttered sqare foot manufacturing plant in sherman texas the plant will be used to manufacture vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsels a special kind of semiconductor found in sensors enabling mapping of the external environment it therefore has very wide ranging application in things like augmented reality ar and self driving cars it also enables apple s face id technology that s part of its iphone x finisar has said that apple s contribution which comes from a billion dollar fund it set aside for u s manufacturing support is not in the nature of a debt or equity investment but instead represents anticipated future business between the companies over a period of time vcsel products are currently in short supply with the main providers being finisar lumentum and oclaro where oclaro is the smallest and lumentum the leader but finisar has been gearing up to increase production manifold it s unclear at this stage whether apple s agreement with finisar involves the purchase of its entire production which would preclude the company from supplying to android manufacturers like samsung ks etc thus giving apple a competitive edge but apple no doubt secured the deal at very favorable rates as it usually does with its component suppliers so it looks like a good deal for apple and an average one for finisar because apple supply agreements usually mean good volumes at very low profit margins toshiba wdc are friends again toshiba and western digital have agreed to settle all disputes between them which means western digital s withdrawal of all its legal proceedings against toshiba and allowing the sale of toshiba s memory chip business to k k pangea a special purpose acquisition company formed and controlled by a consortium led by bain and including apple and wdc competitors seagate and hynix at the same time they agreed on mutual protections for their assets and confidential information in connection with the sale of toshiba memory and on collaborating to ensure the future success of toshiba memory as a

microsoft nasdaq msft and google have reportedly raised objections to a takeover of qualcomm nasdaq qcom by broadcom nasdaq avgo they have said that broadcom has a history of cutting cost rather than investing in innovation that could hurt their own expansion plans microsoft is currently working on arm based windows pcs that could for the first time help it diversify away from the architecture any scale back from qualcomm s side could impact this strategy most of google s android devices use qualcomm chips so it could also be affected by the deal the other reason is that broadcom is cozy with prime competitor apple which could make matters worse for them regulators often collect feedback from the industry to better understand the situation before a deal is approved so this objection could get in the way but qualcomm has reportedly asked companies to shelve public statements to see if broadcom raises the offer significantly from the current a share if that isn t forthcoming there could be more press and publicity on the matter seagate job cuts seagate has announced yet another job cut as it continues to struggle against the onslaught of flash memory technology that continues to eat

private buys and sells in real time our experts cover all kinds of trades value momentum etfs stocks under stocks that corporate insiders are buying up and companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises you can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors', 'if you are willing to overlook the current fear about over valuation in tech stocks you can buy a cap weighted tech etf and as the big go so goes your etf which is definitely not a bad thing or instead you can buy a tech equal weighted etf and get broader diversification also not a bad thing you can slice and dice between large cap and small cap us and foreign and on and on for me however selecting etfs that best represent what i see as the top tech trends beats any other approach technology continues to change our lives mostly for the better whether it is advances in medical care like less invasive surgery cheaper and better energy production via hydraulic fracturing onshoring more manufacturing via robotics or improving the safety of our automobiles aircraft and other modes of transportation technology is everywhere around us and everywhere having an impact many of the companies investing the most in technology are not considered tech companies per se because they are on the leading edge of technology uses well beyond silicon valley innovation is where you find it for me limiting my interest to internet based tech such as browsers and big data domination or social media leadership or e retailing hegemony misses the whole point of how technology can be a force for powering the economy and energizing industry if you disagree and want only those companies in quotation marks above almost any passive cap weighted etf will do powershares qqq trust series nasdaq qqq and fidelity nasdaq composite nasdaq oneq while not really tech funds but because they are cap weighted have portfolios dominated by tech companies for purer play etfs like ishares global tech nyse ixn technology select sector spdr nyse xlk vanguard information technology nyse vgt fidelity msci information technology nyse ftec ishares us technology nyse iyw and ishares north american tech nyse igm the percentage of the portfolio in techs is even higher from a purely investment standpoint the most successful way to have profited from tech stocks in the past couple years has been to buy the faangs facebook nasdaq fb apple nasdaq aapl amazon nasdaq amzn netflix nasdaq nflx and the different iterations of google nasdaq googl the next best was to buy etfs like those above since the faangs are typically or more of their portfolios it is a given in many quarters that the question isn t if it s when everything we do will be either controlled by or of direct and immediate benefit and massive profit to these companies so there was no concern for what price one paid the big discussion on tech message boards was more about whether google would conquer all or would it be amazon such narratives are dangerous thinking in a linear fashion that what is will continue to be and can be meaningfully extrapolated into the distant future or in a binary way that if outcome a doesn t happen that means that outcome b must is a sure path to a pauper s grave right now critical thinking and a little review of history are of far greater value john d rockefeller s standard oil empire was to the industrial age and automobile transportation infancy what today s faangs are for many an unstoppable force until the politicians stepped in as they did with dupont nyse dd the new haven railroad and others a politician can destroy a hegemon in the blink of a regulation or the hint of a busted trust more recently when apple looked to be down for the count microsoft nasdaq msft was the company in every institutional portfolio the future was computing and microsoft controlled the operating system that allowed us to compute then microsoft took a hard fall it took a complete reassessment and a lot of innovation for microsoft to regain some of its former glory but famnags just doesn t roll off the tongue as smoothly so msft is unlikely to bump through into the higher acronymic atmosphere even if no rabble rousing politician or politicians change the course of success for these companies some of us are reluctant to buy something so highly valued during what may prove to be so late in the cycle i just can t bring myself to pay close to times earnings and receive not a penny in dividends from the likes of amazon or netflix brilliant companies with first mover advantage and moats they are reinforcing and expanding daily however i try never to let my respect for a company or its management or its service cloud my judgment as to the value of its shares at a given price i can love amazon and do without thinking their stock has to continue on its current linear route with nary a bump in the road that brings us to equal weighted tech etfs they make more sense at least on paper and in a normal market whatever that is they will provide better diversification and might also provide better total returns but not lately the momentum has clearly been with the mega giants that comprise the faangs and a few of their closest friends nvidia nasdaq nvda microsoft etc to buy into the equal weighted philosophy is easy but the reality has been that you have been left well behind the major tech moves if you did so up until now anyway guggenheim invest s p equal weight technology nyse ryt is the best known of these funds but direxion nasdaq equal weighted shares nyse qqqe and first trust nasdaq equal weighted nasdaq qqew are also reasonably sized players in this space going global is not difficult many passive cap weighted tech etfs invest globally not just in the us the exception is if the index is a subset of the s p s p banished foreign names from the s p a while ago so if getting a piece of tencent hk otc tcehy or baidu nasdaq bidu or whatever foreign security you d like to own you probably don t want to buy xlk then there is the way i am currently investing for my family accounts and clients i don t always mind passive as long as i control the sector sub sector decision whether it is domestic or global and fundamentally or equally or cap weighted no matter how you slice it any bet on tech involves a guess forecast prognostication about what our world will look like in coming years and how technological solutions will solve problems and form new industries and as i alluded above i think the technology that created the ability for horizontal fracturing with high speed drills and better seismic data will make north america the new middle east of gas and oil for the benefits to the economy the work force and the national defense this tech innovation is at least on a par with e tailing or social media i am not discounting the intellectual and culture changing significance of e tailing and social media or the encyclopedic value of having searched for information available at our fingertips but if you didn t already jump on board i think there are better valuations and similar growth to be found elsewhere a move from to is impressive but no different in terms of portfolio return than a move from to or to i see three sub sectors with the greatest combination of world changing innovation and valuations that are reasonable given their growth prospects the three areas i see the greatest future for are cybersecurity robotics and artificial intelligence ai in the intelligence community we long ago treated hacking spoofing phishing and such as what it is cyber warfare the corporate non defense and intelligence government agencies and individual users as well are now beginning to realize this is not only warfare it is truly the long war it doesn t matter how secure you believe you are some sad little nonentity is working in his mom s basement to penetrate your defenses steal your data encrypt it then ransom it back to you if they feel like it after they ve gotten your money or maybe he ll only destroy all your most important files just because he s just a malicious little sob magnify this scenario times and put billions of dollars and tens of thousands of government hackers behind it and you have russian chinese or other type of propaganda delivered by parties separated or times removed from the true source plans by potential adversaries to knock out electric power water and sewer etc in mid winter asymmetrically knock out battlefield innovations like gps and iff identification friend or foe and so on all without firing a single shot cybersecurity is an industry really in its infancy we all need to do a better job of protecting everything from our personal files to our national infrastructure the way we protect ourselves from this is called cybersecurity cybersecurity is the corpus of physical protection and various technologies and processes designed to protect networks data and computers from damage attack or any kind of unauthorized access it also involves a component not always considered when defining it but critical to success end user education as well cybersecurity is an industry really in its infancy we all need to do a better job of protecting everything from our personal files to our national infrastructure i use the analogy of electronic warfare ew to place cybersecurity in context the moment an adversary reaches a breakthrough in electronic warfare we need to find a counter ew technology or process then the enemy creates a counter counter eqw platform or process or like ew cybersecurity is constantly evolving one of the department of defense s prime cybersecurity contractors is ca technologies one of its ctos before ca acquired layer technologies said it best a few years ago the threat is advancing quicker than we can keep up with it the threat changes faster than our idea of the risk it s no longer possible to write a large white paper about the risk to a particular system you would be rewriting the white paper constantly how big is the cybersecurity market big enough to accommodate every firm in every cybersecurity etf according to forbes the global cybersecurity market reached billion for and is expected to hit billion in there are two fine etfs in the cybersecurity industry i like them both equally well and own roughly equivalent amounts of each the first is the purefunds ise cyber security etf nyse hack its biggest holdings include palo alto networks nyse panw akamai technologies nasdaq akam barracuda networks nyse cuda gigamon nyse gimo and fireeye nasdaq feye the first trust nasdaq cybersecurity etf nasdaq cibr shares its two top spots with those of hack but then follows these with cisco nasdaq csco juniper networks nyse jnpr and symantec nasdaq symc both have the exact same management expenses though hack is the older of the two by a few months and hence got the bigger share of total assets hack has billion in assets and average volume of shares a day traded cibr has million in assets and trades just over per day on average hack has more smaller firms which may be more nimble cibr has more large better capitalized companies in its stable both are well worth your consideration if i were only to buy one it would be cibr it is volume weighted rather than cap weighted so it attracts more liquid holdings personally i like bigger maybe slower firms with deeper pockets we re talking a billion dollar sized pie in just years i think those firms with the deepest pockets will spend the most on r d and acquire many of the younger firms i also really respect first trust s research methodology moving on many investors confuse robotics and artificial intelligence some robotic applications require the use of artificial intelligence but many do not the bad thing about humans is that we can be whip smart intelligent but often the more intelligent we are the more easily we become bored computers at least so far don t get bored programmed with a repetitive task such as on an assembly line those robotic assemblies designed controlled and maintained by humans will do the same task in the same way at the exact same point hundreds of thousands of times enter robo the robo global robotics and automation etf robo is very much a global etf clearly the us doesn t have a lock on great automation companies notably missing among robo s top holdings are mainland china firms for good reason there is just one that makes the cut at of the portfolio nine japanese companies are represented however with switzerland taiwan germany and finland rounding out the roster along with us firms of course china s problems are less about efficient use of new technologies than about keeping a potentially restive population employed among robo s top holdings are irobot nasdaq irbt aerovironment nasdaq avav japan s daifuku t no us symbol intuitive surgical nasdaq isrg and japan s keyence t again no us symbol given this global perspective and the cost of doing business on other world exchanges robo has expenses of it has total assets of million and average daily volume in excess of shares traded source robo global presentation what s to like or not like about robo depending on your perspective both answers are the same the parent etf provider has just one offering robo in the us and a clone fund for the eu so they conceived of the index their etf is following that may seem a bit incestuous to some or they are simply passionate about their product and focused on its success you decide one way to do that is to visit their website roboglobal com i appreciate seeing the panoply of information available and recommend their website for your due diligence finally if you are looking for an etf that features companies applying artificial intelligence in the real world you might consider the ark industrial innovation etf nyse arkq ark industrial innovation is likely to be more volatile than the others so a smaller position may be warranted for those who don t care for volatility why might it be more volatile well it s top holdings comprise of the portfolio and they are all market darlings that have risen astronomically over the past few years they are tesla nasdaq tsla of which i am not a particular fan israel s stratasys nasdaq ssys nvidia nasdaq nvda proto labs nyse prlb and amazon amzn you want momentum stocks this etf s got big mo which of course can up and bite you on the downside arkq has an expense ratio of and average daily trading volume of just enter limit orders this is an actively traded fund not passive with a manager defined roster of industries primarily those in the robotics printing and autonomous vehicle arena such narrow focus funds with large amounts in one or two or a half dozen companies live by the growth sword or die by the growth sword this is an exciting area and there is lots of good news yet to come as there are breakthroughs being made every day in this field but i still consider this the riskiest of the three sub sectors covered here today it is also a thematic etf with a difficult to pin down theme industrial innovation which can take many forms and if portfolio manager catherine wood decides company xyz is quite the innovator in her opinion they can add it you as the owner of this etf may decide that s not what you thought they meant depending on your viewpoint this may be the best or worst thing about arkq the etf has a active share versus the s p that doesn t mean it is uncorrelated to what happens in the stock markets but it does mean that if you want to diversify beyond the s p here s a fund that has of its portfolio in the stock of companies that are not in the s p given arkq s momentum bias it isn t surprising that the company i believe will once more reinvent itself this time as the leader in ai isn t even in the top holdings i refer of course to ibm nyse ibm love it or hate it never discount ibm s ability to rise from the ashes but that s a story for a whole nuther article concluding this one my trifecta of etfs in the three tech areas i believe offer the greatest reward over the coming years are in order of my personal preference cibr and or hack closely followed by robo with arkq a momentum favorite receiving the smallest share of my portfolio please remember these etfs invest in volatile industries i suggest trailing stops especially on arkq in my case this late in a wonderful bull buying into these leading edge sub sectors i m keeping stops very tight at or so better to cut losses and buy again hopefully at least another below our selling price that s short term long term i think all three will reward me quite well disclaimer do your due diligence what s right for me may not be right for you past performance is no guarantee of future results rather an obvious statement but most people look solely at past performance instead of seeking the alpha that comes from a solid rational approach they can agree with']\n",

      "['this week over of s p companies are set to release their third quarter earnings reports and one of the most noteworthy firms on this list of giants is the largest semiconductor maker in the world intel nasdaq intc investors will want to pay close attention to intel when it reports its third quarter earnings on thursday as its results could underscore the growth of several major tech sector trends the company is currently a zacks rank strong buy and sports an overall vgm grade of b and though shares of intel have gained only this year which is less than the s p and well below the industry s average gain the stock does currently rest firmly near its week high these lofty heights can be attributed to intel s climb over the last weeks including a nearly gain in the last month alone however nvidia nasdaq nvda amd nasdaq amd and other semiconductor companies have helped to curb intel s sector wide dominance in we expect intel to post earnings of cents per share and revenues of billion based on our latest consensus estimates and intense competition among the top semiconductor players is part of the reason for these relatively flat projections yet for the full year intel is expected to post earnings growth of and revenue growth of this should be good news for investors but as we know revenue and earnings are not the only things that matter more detailed dives into intel s third quarter are needed in order to gain a better understanding of the company s current strength this is where we can check our exclusive non financial metrics estimates file to help determine how some of intel s specific divisions including its vitally important data center group are expected to perform these important stock drivers are from our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file these estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts intel s data center business accounts for nearly half of the company s operating margin the company expects data center segment revenue which includes cloud computing and large servers will grow through based on our current consensus estimates we expect intel s data center group revenues will climb over in from billion to billion the company s enterprise focused segment has grown as the demand for data storage and high performance networks has increased exponentially as the number of smartphones and internet connected devices grows coupled with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing intel s data center business will expand and our current growth projection for this large business segment should make many investors very happy for more stock moving estimates ahead of intel s report check out our full guide and make sure to check

further into the busiest stretch of the earnings season investors are starting to turn their attention to the upcoming report from intel nasdaq intc the largest semiconductor company in the world this chip making behemoth will release its third quarter financial results on thursday october the semiconductor industry has been red hot in especially as demand from emerging markets like cloud computing and the internet of things continues to heat up however intel shares which are up on the year have lagged the industry s gains intel s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with the chipmaker s competition recently intel has felt pressure from the likes of nvidia nasdaq nvda and advanced micro devices nasdaq amd nvidia s artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming ai industry while amd has doubled down on its server chips and both of these companies compete with intel in the ever important gaming segment but have nvidia and amd done enough to put a dent in intel s upcoming earnings report well one approach to answering this question is to focus on intel s core business segments luckily by using our exclusive non financial metrics estimates file we can gauge analyst sentiment and predict the company s performance in its key units these important stock driving estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts because of nvidia and amd s popularity in the gaming market we might expect to see an impact in intel s client computing group this business segment includes the company s products designed for notebooks and desktops so it could certainly feel the effects of these gaming friendly chipmakers according to our latest consensus estimates the client computing group is expected to post revenues of billion which would represent a slump of about from the billion posted in the year ago period still while this dip could imply that intel is losing some market share in the personal computing space the company has made some strides in this area recently for example intel recently launched its eighth generation core processors which should lift the company s gaming endeavors and on top of this the client computing group has been a surprise performer for intel this year in fact in the second quarter intel posted revenues of billion in this unit that results smashed our consensus estimate of billion and marked year over year growth of nearly heading into its report intel is sporting a zacks rank strong buy the stock also has a positive earnings esp of so we can feel more confident about the company s chance at an earnings beat

recently that has been to the downside this stock has rallied into and earnings only to fall in the month following the results keep that in mind in anticipation of this upcoming report intel has beaten eps estimates for every quarter since and rarely do they miss revenue it appears the largest driver for this company on earnings reports is forward guidance due to the significant cyclicality in the semiconductor space cpu battlethe fight for cpu market share is flaring between semiconductor powerhouses intel and advanced micro devices intel has been the industry leader in pc and server cpus for years but recent execution issues have allowed amd to come in and swooped up the free market share if you are a big pc gamer or computer whiz i am sure you are more than familiar with the differences between intel and amd chips and likely have an opinion on the quality price mix for the laymen a cpu stands for a central processing unit and is effectively the brain of a computer server this technology is continuously advancing with the year old moore s law still being relevant today gordon moore one of the co founders of intel stated that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every years while the cost is cut in half which means that computers will continue to become exponentially faster and more efficient while at the same time cheaper moore s law still holds today the number of transistors on a microchip depends on the size of the transistor nodes which halve every few years amd has started shipping node cpus while intel is struggling to unveil its chips which have experienced excessive delays intel originally intended to ship its chips back in but had issues on its node chips an atom is to nanometers nm to put into perspective the atomic level in which this is measured intel s recent production issues and delays in next generation cpus have allowed amd to pounce and take a substantial amount of market share intel had been dominating the cpu market for years but recent events have allowed amd to take market share with their ability to not only create the highest performing cpu but at a lower price point currently intel controls of the cpu market while amd has been able to take a share from the less than it controlled a couple of years ago intel doesn t work with the world s foundry tsmc for its cpu innovation and production which is setting them behind the curve tsmc is partnered with amd to surpass the cpu giant and they seem to have a competitive advantage tsmc is in the process of developing transistor chips which will be in production by next year intel says it will have chips by and now this timeline may be pushed back intel may be forced to work with tsmc to remain competitive in the cpu space shift to data centricintel is in the midst

along with the rest of their portfolio the pc business remains intel s biggest topline driver but this business is both mature and overly competitive intel is going to have to rely on its data centric businesses for growth moving forward the data centric business is facing competition for the increasingly powerful gpu which nvidia has proven to be effective in data centers gpu s speed and functionality are slowly surpassing that of cpu s but today they work together to create the most propitious computer power take awayintel is falling behind the curve and it appears this may be a trend moving forward as its competitors broaden their competitive moat intel is still a force to be reckoned with in the cpu market but it will continue to lose market share if it is not able to step
