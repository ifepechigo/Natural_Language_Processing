currently trading considerably higher than their median levels the industry has a much lower median value although it is currently trading closer to its week high these comparisons seem to indicate that there is room for further upside in nvda shares p ethe forward months price to earnings ratio for nvda is currently compared to the s p average of and the industry average of the high low and median values are also higher moreover the trend lines indicate that nvda is clearly overvalued both with respect to the s p and the industry p sthe trailing months price to sales ratio tells the same story the p s ratio for nvda is currently which is higher than the s p s but much lower than the x industry s the median of is slightly ahead of the s p s and the industry s the highs and lows also indicate that nvda is overvalued both with respect to the s p and the industry p cfin terms of cash flow nvda s valuation of is much higher than the s p s and the industry s moreover the highs lows and median values are also much higher look at its peers while advanced micro devices is nvidia s closest competitor when it comes to gpus intel is the one that it is increasingly pitted against as both companies look for growth in the data center self driving cars and other iot so let s compare the two first intel s current p e based on forward months earnings is just its price to sales ratio is and its price to cash flow is so nvda is obviously overvalued compared to intel a comparison with another semiconductor company texas instruments shows that this chipmaker has a p e based on forward months earnings of a price to sales ratio of and a price to cash flow of here too nvda looks overvalued conclusionit s true that nvda has a solid pipeline that should continue to generate strong growth for years to come but given the strong competition from companies like intel and ongoing consolidation in the space it could soon see many other competitors so the high valuation with respect to the s p the industry in which it operates and a couple of its semiconductor peers is good reason for caution or at least it s good reason to go for intel or texas instruments instead both these companies have a zacks rank strong buy you can see that s better than the zacks rank buy assigned to nvidia more stock news this is bigger than the iphone it could become the mother of all

for information about the performance numbers displayed in this press release', 'the semiconductor industry is made up of sub sectors including for semiconductor equipment within the technology sector which is one of the broad zacks categorized sectors similar to the technology sector zacks also breaks down each of the other sectors into groups such that there are a total of sub sectors or industries these industries are then ranked based on the average rank of companies comprising the industry therefore the zacks industry rank is a very good indicator of investment opportunities within an industry at any given time moreover because stocks in the same industry have certain common positive or negative factors affecting them it has been observed that even companies with a neutral zacks rank when part of an industry with a positive outlook will perform better than similar ranked stocks in industries with neutral or negative outlooks for this purpose zacks methodology says that theoutlook for industries positioned or lower is positive between and is neutral and and higher is negative as evident from the table below seven of the semiconductor segments are now in positive territory five are neutral and the rest negative note stocks mentioned in the our picks column is based on the individual ranks of stocks zacks rank for individual stocks denotes strong buy is buy means hold sell and strong sell earnings trends at a glance one of the main factors driving the zacks rank for individual stocks is earnings results therefore it makes sense to take a look at how those have been from the latest we see that of technology stocks have reported with results trailing the s p overall technology stocks earnings were up from the year ago quarter on flattish revenue down also beat earnings estimates and an equal percentage beat revenue expectations major drivers this section can be divided into the current and emerging drivers but before getting into that it s important to understand the backdrop this includes a shrinking traditional market mainly pcs that still consumes the bulk of chips as well as several emerging categories that have extremely strong growth potential this means that while the industry as a whole may appear sluggish there are solid opportunities waiting to be picked current drivers as far as current drivers are concerned the most significant are cloud computing big data and artificial intelligence that are increasing demand for servers and data centers exponentially intel and nvidia nvda are the strongest positioned here with intel s strength mainly on the enterprise side and nvidia s on the hpc side intel intc is trying to challenge nvidia but that is easier said than done hpc is where a lot of the innovation is going on and nvidia is set to pick up share of spending because of its lead in machine learning but of course it won t be alone here intel has plans to get in the game with the technology it acquired through nervana systems both companies are working on hybrid solutions because gpus do a better job of processing the huge amounts of data to train a neural network while cpus do a better job of applying that data to a given situation xilinx nasdaq xlnx is another important player working with fpgas on top of arm based chips some disruption is afoot in the enterprise segment as well because of the work done by the open compute project ocp that facebook nasdaq fb fb founded and continues to feed the social networking company generates huge volumes of data that it needs to store manage and process as quickly and cost efficiently as possible others with similar interest like apple aapl microsoft msft and google nasdaq googl and differing interest like intel hp cisco csco and juniper are also part of the project facebook designs the chip that is then optimized by the ocp so it becomes something members can standardize on so far so good but if the ocp is able to design chips that perform better or comparably with intel chips the chip maker s cloud business can be hurt this explains why intel is part of the effort but intel has other challengers too google seems to be testing out international business machines ibm new chip designs it is reportedly the only top chip buyer that doesn t sell servers but instead builds them for internal use therefore google s decisions are significant in the chip consumption context google has done two things in the past that could be viewed as second sourcing or maybe creating leverage against intel to pressure it into lowering prices the company has declared that everything it now does also supports ibm s power systems and it is also in talks with qualcomm nasdaq qcom that could result in its using some of its arm based server chips amazon nasdaq amzn is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure followed by microsoft ibm and google this is another chip hungry segment with long term demand for the devices this is perhaps the reason that some time back amazon started dabbling with low end arm chips the company looks interested in making its own devices but it s still too early to comment on its progress meanwhile google is testing ibm and arm technology while microsoft is collaborating with qualcomm to use arm technology in its internal servers it is probably only a matter of time before intel sees notable competition intel s only course of action is to innovate around the problem increasing performance while reducing cost per watt is a way it could do this after all it s hard to convince people that you deserve to make a nice margin another significant development is intel s decision to license arm technology perhaps to support its foundry business or help it speed up its iot effort or maybe even to use in some segments of the cloud computing market another important segment for semiconductor companies that is relatively low key is industrial since semiconductors facilitate increased automation on the factory floor they are increasingly used to drive efficiency and lower cost reportedly pricewaterhousecoopers pwc expects the industrial semiconductor market to grow at a cagr compounded annual growth rate of between and a global industry analysts gia report says that the u s is the largest market for industrial semiconductors although the asia pacific is the fastest growing on account of its being a manufacturing hub the overall market is expected to be worth billion by ic insights estimates that global medical semiconductor sales will grow at a cagr to reach billion in it s not clear if this estimate includes wearables that are normally considered iot and therefore included in consumer wearables carry an increasing amount of medical information and consume a good number of semiconductor devices databeans attributes continued strength in this vertical to the need to reduce healthcare cost expected to double from the current trillion over the next few years the need to extend healthcare to underserved areas and convenience the need to improve overall disease management from the comfort of your own home one of the fastest growing emerging markets for semiconductor devices is automotive as the consumption of electronic components for safety infotainment navigation and fuel efficiency continues to increase a recent report from marketsandmarkets says that the automotive semiconductor market will grow at a cagr of from through power components like mosfet and igbt devices are some of the fastest growing because of the increased electrification of vehicles the growing middle class in several asian markets like china india thailand indonesia and malaysia is greatly increasing the demand for passenger cars thus accounting for most of the semiconductor shipments into the automotive market semiconductor consumption in this market was worth around billion in according to reportlinker primary areas of strength were hybrid electric vehicles telematics and connectivity and advanced driver assistance systems adas where the estimated year cagrs for chip demand are and respectively infineon stmicroelectronics renesas which acquired intersil texas instruments txn analog devices adi and spansion owned by cypress are important players qualcomm after its acquisition of nxp semiconductor which itself acquired freescale semiconductor has become a major player in automotive semiconductors similar to medical devices the auto market also has an emerging adjacent market in the form of autonomous self driving cars that will consume a huge number of semiconductors particularly the sensors processors and other technology enabling the vehicles wireless infrastructure builds have been necessitated by increasing data volumes and connectivity issues network congestion power reliability privacy and security in wireless networks these builds will require increased investment in semiconductors thus driving sales new materials a compound of two or more are being used in this segment with galium nitride gaining share of rf high power semiconductors according to abi research according to strategy analytics the greatest driver of these compound semiconductors is the convergence of voice video and data networks that is leading to the explosive growth of data traffic across wireless devices within fixed and wireless networks in driver assistance systems in network centric battlefield philosophies solid state lighting and high power electronics the firm expects compound semiconductor revenue to grow at a compounded average annual growth rate caagr to double revenue to billion by the pc market still consumes a large number of chips but its importance as a driver continues to decline that s because the market itself is shrinking gartner estimates that it declined in the third quarter while idc estimates that it declined idc believes that north america grew for the second straight quarter while gartner says that sales were consistent with year ago periods both agree on declines in the asia pacific consumers are hesitant to spend on upgrades given that they already have many more devices than they need developed markets and because internet and many other conveniences of computers are now easily available on smartphones and tablets emerging markets but gaming enthusiasts demand stronger and faster machines which is the main driver of pc sales and chips right now in either case it s very clear that the steady growth seen in yesteryears is history idc for one expects the pc market to shrink in so semiconductor players with pc market exposure can at best profit from market share gains byod exposure and increased exposure to the top pc vendors which are lenovo hp dell asus and apple according to both idc and gartner apple makes its own pcs software and also a lot of its own processors relying largely on intel qualcomm and samsung ks for its other semiconductor requirements microsoft makes software and limited quantities of hardware relying largely on third party device makers for chips pcs and mobile devices it s also a major player in the cloud which makes it an important ally for semiconductor companies like intel qualcomm or nvidia alphabet s chromebooks on the other hand are made by a number of hardware makers that use either intel or arm technology emerging drivers traditionally the consumer technology market included smartphones tablets and electronic gadgets like lcd tvs and blu ray players but that is changing as we speak with the consumer technology association cta formerly called consumer electronics association cea estimating that u s consumer technology retail sales will be driven by iot this year to touch billion moreover these traditional segments are expected to decline this year with their contribution dropping to less than of total sales for the first time next year smartphones tablets and tvs are mature categories with shipments expected to grow a respective and laptops will decline the estimated growth rate for hybrids convertibles and detachables wasn t refreshed so assuming it remains at of the emerging technology categories ultra hd tvs will grow wearables will grow fitness trackers up smart watches up smart home encompassing products like thermostats smart smoke and detectors ip wi fi cameras smart locks smart home systems and smart switches dimmers and outlets will grow drones will grow vr voice activated digital assistants like amazon s echo and printing most of the emerging technology categories fall in the category more commonly referred to as internet of things iot a recent mckinsey report says that the installed base of iot devices was in the range of billion at end and is expected to increase by about annually over the next few years to billion units by ic insights estimates that iot semiconductor sales will increase in to billion and will grow at a cagr of from to for the firm expects iot semiconductor revenue growth in smart cities of to billion connected vehicles to million wearables to billion connected homes to million and industrial internet chip to billion however despite the strong revenue prospects this is still a nascent market with several challenges to its continued growth these would be security privacy because of the huge amount of data generated and collected still limited availability of consistent standards enabling interoperability relatively low roi for chipmakers necessitating the integration of additional technology or the final product by the chipmaker and the possibility of a growing number of niche products companies are doubling down on these challenges for instance freescale now part of nxp is part of the embedded microprocessor benchmarking consortium eembc to identify embedded security gaps and set guidelines for iot manufacturers to make more secure devices also both intel and arm now acquired by softbank have increased focus on security intel is working on building chip level security while also facilitating security in the cloud through the mcafee data exchange layer in arm s case the company acquired israeli startup sansa which offers both hardware security technology and software for advanced socs used in the iot market the company will likely build some security features into its designs on the standardization front companies like intel ibm cisco ge and at t nyse t have formed the industrial internet consortium to develop common standards the process could take time but once available the standards could generate higher margin revenue for semiconductor players there will however be increased scrutiny on privacy considerations component forecast the semiconductor industry association sia estimates that semiconductor sales in were up from levels versus expectations of a increase logic memory and micro ics were the top three segments sensors and actuators was the fastest growing segment up nand flash up dsp diodes small signal transistors and analog regionally china was strongest up followed by japan up while asia pacific all other dropped europe dropped and the americas were down wsts data projects growth of previous driven by sensors analog and memory it will be followed by growth in ic insights has doubled its growth forecast to previous because of

nvidia gained nearly in morning trading wednesday just one day before the company is scheduled to release its fiscal fourth quarter earnings report the wall street darling was hit hard by the recent market wide sell off but the stock is now almost fully recovered and investors can be sure that the company s report will attract significant attention nvidia has quickly moved to the forefront of the global investing scene over the past two years largely due to the company s focus on innovative technology the santa clara california based firm manufactures graphics processing units gpu and system on a chip units socs that are considered the top of the line in their respective industries nvidia s traditional business focuses on delivering gpus to the gaming market and socs to the mobile computing market but over the past few years its technology has exploded in popularity throughout several budding new industries and is now used in smart vehicles datacenters cryptocurrency mining artificial intelligence and autonomous driving on the back of growth in these new markets and excitement for what these industries could bring in the future nvidia shares have skyrocketed more than over the past two years including a strong climb over the past weeks but this share price explosion has also ushered in ludicrous expectations for the company so the pressure will be on nvidia to deliver another solid quarterly report tomorrow based on our current consensus estimates we expect management to report adjusted earnings of per share and total revenues of billion these results would represent year over year growth rates of and respectively that growth is a bit slower than we have grown to expect from nvidia but the company is starting to face tougher prior year comparisons which should force investors to adjust a bit with that said it is entirely possible that wall street hones in on nvidia s performance in specific key businesses as opposed to its overall results this could be a more effective method for judging the company s position right now to prepare for this we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file the zacks consensus nfm file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies the data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts investors will rightfully be interested in several of nvidia s exciting growth catalysts but it is also important to track how the company s core video gaming business is holding up our consensus estimate file is calling for nvidia to report gaming revenues of billion up about from the year ago period however nvidia notched growth in gaming revenues last quarter so investors will hope that the company s holiday shopping season was stronger than analysts are expecting one division that will likely grow in magnitude over the next few years is the company s automotive segment this is still a relatively small revenue driver but as the demand for ai powered autonomous driving grows nvidia should stand to benefit for the fourth quarter our consensus estimates are calling for nvidia to report automotive revenues of million which would represent year over year growth of about last quarter nvidia posted segment revenues of million up so it looks like growth rates are expected to pick up finally investors are going to want to pay special attention to nvidia s datacenter business which has been one of its fastest growing units in recent months last quarter nvidia reported datacenter revenues of million up from the year ago period based on our consensus estimates we expect to see nvidia post datacenter revenues of million for that would represent year over year growth of from the million that was witnessed last year growth is certainly nothing to scoff at but investors have grown accustom to triple digit datacenter growth over

have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates there have been revisions higher for the current quarter last month the consensus estimate has shifted by due to these changes nvidia corporation price and consensus vgm scores at this time nvda has a strong growth score of a though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a c however the stock was allocated a grade of f on the value side putting it in the bottom for this investment strategy overall the stock has an aggregate vgm score of c if you aren t focused on one strategy this score is the one you should be interested in our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than momentum investors outlook estimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising it comes with little surprise nvda has a zacks rank strong buy we expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months', 'for immediate releasechicago il jan highlights nvidia nasdaq nvda as the bull of the day vulcan materials nyse vmc as the bear of the day in addition zacks equity research provides analysis on alibaba nyse baba here is a synopsis of all three stocks i last wrote about nvidia as the bull of the day in mid november after another strong quarterly report instead of sustaining new highs above shares fell nearly to support under as the semiconductor group acquiesced to extremely overbought conditions and this despite analysts raising nvda s eps estimates from a consensus to with several high end projections near still at that would make nvda trade at times the most optimistic forward estimates and so nervous holders with any profits are quick to run on any excuse we saw that excuse as a great opportunity in early december to add more nvda shares in my portfolio here s what i told my members on december about a potentially fading opportunity to still buy nvda near as i ve written numerous times this is the one to own for ai engines and advanced hpc high performance computing applications nvidia builds systems on a chip soc that are fueling so many different bleeding edge industries from autonomous driving robotics and big data mining to cancer genomic research medical diagnosis and cyber security that all require massively parallel architecture mpa and as the nvidia press page reminds us this week the year in tech wakes up early with the annual international consumer electronics show ces in las vegas on sunday january at when nvidia founder and ceo jensen huang takes the stage to talk about the company s automotive platforms as always we can also expect a flurry of related surprises from nvidia to explain the long tail of nvidia s growth and dominance within and connected to several technology industries let s review what i wrote in mid november is nvda too expensive at but many investors wonder if the stock is still a buy as it now trades for times trailing month earnings as an nvda investor i have a bias that says yes i would still be a buyer near and after this most recent quarterly report as i go over the growth profile in all its different business segments and customers i find multiple reasons to reinforce this view in sum as long as the leading provider of gaming processors high performance computing in data centers and emerging ai technologies keeps delivering solid double digit sales and earnings growth along with upside surprises each quarter then paying times the current projection for next year s profits isn t a bad proposition so two important questions follow will the market demand for hpc ai solutions in data center gaming and automotive segments continue to grow at high double digits can nvidia maintain their dominant position even as intel nasdaq intc buys mobileye otc mbbyf for a foothold in driverless cars and forges a renewed alliance with old arch enemy advanced micro devices nasdaq amd to establish a front in gpu processor markets to help you decide whether the current multiple is too expensive for nvidia s growth this article will go over the current and forecast leadership of nvidia and why some wall street investment banks believe the company is on its way to earning per share in which would equate to a multiple at high street targets near every major dude will tell youin early november i was reviewing all the big announcements at the beijing gpu tech conference in late september in particular that the giants of china e commerce alibaba baidu and tencent were all new cloud datacenter customers i came away with the insight that everybody is their customer now then on monday november from the supercomputing conference in denver nvidia issued a press release highlighting the exact thing nvidia chosen by every major computer maker every major clouddenver nov globe newswire nvidia today announced the world s most advanced data center gpu the nvidia tesla nasdaq tsla gpu based on nvidia s volta architecture is available through every major computer maker and chosen by every major cloud to deliver artificial intelligence and high performance computing dell emc nyse emc hewlett packard enterprise huawei ibm nyse ibm and lenovo have all announced volta based offerings for their customers providers such as alibaba cloud amazon nasdaq amzn web services baidu cloud microsoft nasdaq msft azure oracle nyse orcl cloud and tencent cloud have also announced volta based cloud services building on this breadth of offerings nvidia has introduced new software and tools on the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry that make it easy for scientists to deploy nvidia s accelerated computing platform for compute intensive research end of nvidia press release excerpt while i really like the fact that some of my favorite cloud builders and ai innovators like alibaba and baidu are nvidia customers i am even more impressed that amazon and microsoft are let s explore why volta is nvidia s latest advance in hpc architecture it delivers over teraflops per second tflops of deep learning performance over a increase compared to the prior generation nvidia pascal architecture it s important to understand that nvidia doesn t just make hpc parallel processing chips for gaming datacenter ai and other applications the gpu chips with thousands of cores come embedded in some version of an overall platform known as cuda compute unified device architecture which allows developers to immediately begin programming in a common language say c what they want the machine learning system to do so the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry adds a new level of service and ease of use for corporations applying the technology in short nvidia has just outdone themselves again in winning over the developer and enterprise communities by creating an extended platform which simplifies software integrations deep learning is nvidia s businessstick with me on mapping who nvidia s customers are and just as importantly why they are if you understand this end demand for the technology from the who s who of big tech companies you will better appreciate the potential value of nvidia s growth segments and the coming explosion of ai applications that i am going to describe for you in the last two sections so how does nvidia speak to both individual developers and massive enterprises after they build a cuda architecture they make sure that data scientists entrepreneurs and organizations can use it in may the company announced that their deep learning institute was expanding the number and availability of programming courses at little or no cost with the goal of training developers by the end of and on october nvidia announced immediate availability of the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry for ai developers worldwide here was the word from that pr in just a few steps ngc helps developers get started with deep learning development through no cost access to a comprehensive easy to use fully optimized deep learning software stack the cloud based service is available immediately to users of the just announced amazon elastic compute cloud amazon instances featuring nvidia tesla gpus nvidia plans to expand support to other cloud platforms soon after signing up for an ngc account developers can download a containerized software stack that integrates and optimizes a wide range of deep learning frameworks nvidia libraries and cuda runtime versions which are kept up to date and run seamlessly in the cloud or on nvidia dgx systems the nvidia gpu cloud democratizes ai for a rapidly expanding global base of users said jim mchugh vice president and general manager of enterprise systems at nvidia ngc frees developers from the complexity of integration allowing them to move quickly to create sophisticated neural networks that deliver the transformative powers of ai end of nvda pr excerpt from oct also at the supercomputing conference in denver where dozens of computer makers and cloud service providers launched a wide range of volta based products and services ceo and nvidia founder jensen huang proudly described what he must regard as their greatest overall achievement volta is the world s most powerful platform for ai and hpc and will allow the world s top minds in scientific research to push the limit on what s possible in areas like drug discovery alternative fuel sources and predicting natural disasters with volta now in data centers and clouds around the world a new wave of innovation is underway that will have an incredible impact across society with every major computer and cloud provider adopting nvidia technology the runway appears clear for continued sales growth over the next years how far will segment growth fly before i break down nvidia s segment growth let me share a few important notes on terminology inference is the term used to describe the next level of machine learning after training inference is sometimes referred to as deep learning after scientists have trained a system on data then they can have it apply the data set and knowledge to learn new things think of the initial training as establishing weights for data baselines and inference as advanced pattern recognition gaming is still nvidia s biggest end market claiming nearly of the company s projected billion in sales this year and still growing at over annually and gaming is still the largest global entertainment industry at over billion in annual sales in september i read several investment bank research reports which indicated that nvidia could continue to grow their cloud datacenter business at over annually for the next years with sales projections ranging from to billion in just for this segment results delivered confirmation of that optimism with volta adoption driving datacenter segment sales to million representing sequential quarter over quarter and annual year over year growth nvda noted that there are now more than companies using its volta based inference platform and this is why many wall street analysts are so enthusiastic about the continued growth in the datacenter space especially since the total addressable market tam is expected to push over billion in the next to years automotive is currently a small sales contributor for nvidia at just under of total revenues but the segment is growing at nearly as nvidia forms key partnerships in europe with bosch and paccar nasdaq pcar and in china with baidu to deliver autonomous driving technology even cryptocurrency mining is a growth category for nvidia although it may never contribute more than of total sales the biggest market yet for ai gpu parallel processing architectures will continue to sweep business away from old line cpu serial processing architectures in the computing market since gaming datacenter automotive and crypto mining are all parallel applications growing strong double digits nvidia has a clear path to double revenues in the next to years but there are advanced computing markets on the horizon that many investors haven t thought much about yet and probably some analysts haven t even incorporated these markets into their models to highlight one of them i ve been in a surreal state of shock since i read a recent bank of america nyse bac research report about augmented reality in it the bofa ml analysts calculate that last year s total market revenues tied to ar were billion in they are forecasting this market to grow to billion that s a increase over years that s a cagr compound annual growth rate of i don t know what they see but i like it bottom line as artificial intelligence applications become embedded in so many industries and facets of life so too will nvidia technology disclosure i own shares of nvda

earnings might grow a little in but are in danger of falling in see more below with the economy only growing slightly and earnings looking decent but not strong it s hard to see many new positive

sales on thursday and housing starts and building permits on friday it s shaping up to be a big week from the perspective of consumer health which drives so much of the economy the data could be worth watching more closely than usual simply because the market is on edge about the fed s next move if the numbers on retail sales and housing look strong it could play into thoughts that the fed might not want to get too aggressive lowering rates further it could be another example of good news being bad weekly jobless claims on thursday were better than expected another possible signal of economic

s going to be interesting to see if it can stay that way if bonds start rallying again speaking of which both gold and bonds recovered some territory late thursday from earlier lows that could reinforce feelings that we re far from out of the woods which is true enough one thing to consider watching today is whether investors feel they can enter the weekend without taking some of thursday s

closed below in nearly a year or above in more than two years however the dollar remains more robust than many people might have gotten used to during the era when it mostly traded below so today s levels might seem challenging to companies selling products overseas you d think the dollar might come under more pressure due to expectations for fed rate cuts but with central banks around the world cutting already and the u s economy among the strongest it s hard to envision the dollar falling too much despite the president s hopes need money if you re the parent of a college student it s the time of year when those scary tuition bills could appear in the mail any day or maybe they have already and they re sitting on the counter waiting for you to open them some investors might be at the

of winter fall in parts of the country friday the stock market also has a chilly tone to start the day concerns about rising rates continue to weigh on sentiment and so does a higher than expected read on u s inflation some investors seem to be seizing on what looked like an unremarkable aspect of the fed s statement yesterday one that was unchanged from the previous meeting the fed said it expects further gradual increases in rates as the economy continues to thrive it s a bit hard to understand any panic about these words because they didn t tell investors anything that most didn t already know still perhaps some people had hoped for a more dovish tone after october s market thrashing and the fed didn t deliver as it is markets fell across europe and asia overnight and pressure might spill over into u s trading speaking of europe there s more drama there as the european commission tangled with italy over the italian government s budget forecasts which the ec said looked too optimistic on deficits moving west debate raged about whether a brexit deal might be getting close and the u k government is holding meetings on the issue this weekend media reports said a brexit breakthrough if it comes might give european markets a boost but it s unclear how close it might be asian markets are on pace to fall for the sixth week out of the last seven back home a slew of fed speakers march out to the microphones today so consider watching for some of their reflections michigan sentiment is also due this morning additionally in a report that might keep the fed on its toes producer prices shot up by in october the biggest monthly climb in six years and way above analyst estimates of higher gas machinery and equipment prices all played a part however it s important to note that core wholesale inflation which strips out volatile energy and food prices rose a little less at and prices over the last year are up below the peak seen last summer with oil now in a tailspin see more below inflationary worries might be lifting in earnings news late thursday disney nyse dis delivered a strong quarter posting earnings per share of and revenue of billion third party

pre market trading the news didn t look so hot over at activision blizzard nasdaq atvi where shares crumbled in the pre market hours after the company missed analysts earnings expectations and saw active users fall fed reflection thursday saw stocks move a bit lower as the fed held rates steady some of the pressure also might have reflected profit taking after a massive rally wednesday that possibly got a bit overdone also the fed stuck to its position of advocating gradual rate hikes meaning no sign of any end to the steady drip drip of higher rates this is the part that seems to be hurting sentiment early friday the fed s decision likely didn t come as a surprise to many but futures prices still predict around a chance of a fourth rate hike by the end of the year fed chair jerome powell is scheduled to make some public comments next week which could give investors more insight into the fed s current thinking the fed s statement thursday didn t evolve much from its last meeting in september as it did then the fed noted economic activity has been rising at a strong rate and job gains have been strong it added that the unemployment rate has dropped and that household spending has continued to grow strongly fed sees business investment moderating the one significant change was around business investment and that follows what looked like a slowdown in that category in the gross domestic product gdp report issued last month growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year the fed s statement now reads back in september the fed s statement said that the category had grown strongly on the inflation front there was no change to the fed s september prediction that price increases would remain near its target over the next months both for overall inflation and core inflation that strips out food and energy prices the fed arguably finds itself in a tough place as it tries to keep the u s economy from overheating even as it faces pressure not to run the value of the dollar so high through tighter monetary policy that it might hurt foreign countries and keep their consumers from being able to afford u s products remember the fed has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment there are signs that a stronger dollar along with recent trade battles might be hurting u s company outlooks in treasuries the year benchmark yield rose slightly to after the fed statement thursday just a few basis points below last month s highs it was at early friday energy loses steam after oil craters energy shares took the biggest hit thursday falling more than as crude oil entered a bear market see more below the dollar index is also back on the climb moving above thursday after falling below earlier this week hawkish fed policy tends to support a strong dollar and that could be a possible stress factor for some sectors like tech industrials and materials with big foreign markets also the dollar is once again climbing vs the chinese yuan with the psychological yuan to the dollar level not far away financials did appear to get a boost from the fed s continued optimistic tone regarding the economy and topped the sector leaderboard thursday in fact financials are outpacing the broader s p index spx over the last week that s kind of a change of pace but it s not clear if it can hold up bank stocks have declined about so far this year and just haven t been able to get going despite this anticipated higher rate environment the stock market is out of correction but the crude market turned bearish thursday u s futures closed below a barrel on thursday down more than from highs above last month generally a drop from high close to low close defines a bear market by early friday the front month u s contract had fallen to the first time a front month has fallen under since march there hasn t been a close below in nearly nine months so perhaps that s worth watching later today thursday s losses were the ninth consecutive lower session for u s crude futures with oil taking a beating from u s production hitting record highs and saudi arabia and russia also gearing up output the long term impact on the energy sector from all this is too soon to tell one bad month probably isn t going to make that big a difference but extended periods of low oil prices can sometimes hinder energy sector earnings growth as investors might remember from the bear oil market of at that point crude fell as low as a barrel in the u s and many oil companies saw dramatic plunges in their earnings it s way too soon to worry about that now and it s also unlikely crude could fall to such bargain basement levels especially considering how healthy the u s economy is now compared to then figure extra cash for holiday shoppers this one month chart comparing the consumer discretionary sector candlestick to the energy sector purple line shows that discretionary stocks are starting to rally back from october lows even as energy continues to wallow near recent lows cheaper oil is hurting the energy sector but might end up helping discretionary by putting a little extra gas savings in holiday shoppers pockets data source s p dow jones indices chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results lower gas costs might help shoppers consumer discretionary has had its rally hat on lately ahead of holiday shopping season and gas prices going back below a gallon across much of the country over the last week probably can t hurt this sector lower gas prices might have a psychological impact making shoppers feel like they can spend a bit more on gifts if they re saving at the pump see chart above stay tuned this weekend for an opec meeting some analysts think opec members might start sending signals soon about lowering output in the face of this price pullback but that s not assured others say saudi

attention and all five of those closely watched stocks are up significantly from their october lows some have even gained in the double digits however if you re looking for the best performing tech stocks since october s depths you won t find the faangs among them instead tech leaders as of thursday afternoon included semiconductor firm advanced micro devices nasdaq amd up from its october low followed by a gain from cybersecurity company symantec nasdaq symc and a rise from xilinx nasdaq xlnx a supplier of programmable logic devices cnbc noted what this might help show is how varied the tech sector is beyond big names like apple nasdaq aapl ibm nyse ibm and microsoft nasdaq msft from a high level view tech still trails the broader s p spx over the last month this partly reflects how so much selling zeroed in on tech shares during october s shakeout for the year so far tech shares are still up more than compared with less than for the spx but tech s rise this year is way short of the better than gains of consider keeping an eye out for a couple of major tech earnings next week from cisco nasdaq csco and nvidia nasdaq nvda which could give insight into the latest macro

easily surpassed the average estimate heading into the report while the pay gains met expectations the labor department also made some minor revisions to past jobs reports lowering september s gain to from but raising august growth to a massive the unemployment rate stayed unchanged in october at a near year low of the hourly wage increase of compared with recent gains of just below so on its face it s not a huge change but investors sometimes pay more attention to big round numbers so there could be a psychological effect to seeing the increase rise above earlier this year a rise sent some investors scurrying for cover amid concerns that higher wages might throw the market into a wage price inflationary cycle that could bring the fed in to clamp down on any possible overheating the same concerns might start creeping in now and chances of a fed rate hike by the end of the year inched higher soon after the data right after friday s report the major indices appeared to hold close to where they d been a few minutes before in pre market trading with the dow jones industrial average dji still pointing to possible point gains after the open in part on optimism about china trade see more below while nasdaq composite comp slumped slightly in part due to disappointment over apple s nasdaq aapl results see more below looking a little deeper into the data leisure and hospitality added the most jobs with and healthcare added but manufacturing and construction which tend to be hallmarks of a booming economy also posted solid gains of and respectively other areas with decent gains included transportation and warehousing and business and professional services it s hard to find anything wrong with this report which showed job creation rising for the consecutive month and continued stellar numbers out of the health care sector the only place where things might have gotten a little overblown was leisure and hospitality which may have seen some pent up demand due to the hurricane earlier this fall under the peel apple earnings as always had the potential to either slow the market s momentum or help put more wind at its back this time the company s results seemed to bring some bears out of the woods as shares sank more than in pre market trading if this holds up it would be the biggest single day decline in aapl shares in more than two years in a nutshell apple s results were certainly not a disaster the quarter had its low and high points but investors seemed to focus at least initially on the disappointing ones though aapl beat third party consensus estimates for both earnings per share and revenue iphone unit sales of million were a bit shy of wall street s estimates the average selling prices for the iphone on the other hand rose to up from the previous quarter and beating factset s estimate of around disappointment seemed to center on the iphone unit sales number and the company s fiscal guidance of billion to billion which was just below the average analyst estimate of billion looking at things from a high level the average selling price gain could be seen as healthy because it might send the message that aapl s higher priced phones are gaining traction with its customer base however the miss on iphone unit sales could indicate that people are waiting longer to replace their old phones not such a good development as for the guidance aapl has often been conservative on its guidance but some investors might have wanted to see aapl projecting a blowout holiday quarter especially after the disappointing holiday quarter guidance from amazon nasdaq amzn last week it also may disappoint some investors to hear that aapl won t break out iphone unit volume in its earnings any more the street doesn t tend to like when companies cut back on what investors see as an important number for guidance lots of companies don t report product unit sales but the iphone arguably isn t just any product china fortunes keep swaying market to get a sense of just how large u s china trade issues loom going into the meeting between the country s leaders later this month consider the action in stocks thursday morning things were chugging along a little higher before a tweet from president trump in which he said he d had a productive conversation with chinese president xi the dji quickly scampered to point gains even though the tweet lacked much detail then early friday stock futures jumped to more big gains after what sounded like encouraging words from president xi on state television according to media reports the point gain in djia futures seemed to come based just on the two leaders comments with no details offered about what kind of agreement might be in store or when it could be reached those gains got pared in the hour ahead of the opening bell after cnbc reported an administration official saying there s a long way to go to reach a deal stocks overseas particularly in asia had risen overnight in part on the trade rumored detente xi and trump are scheduled to meet at the group of buenos aires summit nov dec so investors might want to consider staying tuned for any previews of that the threat of u s tariffs on an additional billion in chinese goods could be one factor that continues to keep the market slightly in check until investors have a better sense of whether these trade issues can get resolved recent economic data from china have been mixed and the u s administration says nothing is set in stone on whether those additional tariffs will take effect media reports said to sum up there s probably no issue right now as close to the minds of most investors as trade with china even the u s midterms arguably don t seem to have as much force this remains one reason why it s probably safe to say that volatility doesn t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon three in a row before aapl and payrolls the stock market posted its third straight day of healthy gains thursday the dow jones industrial average dji has gained points over this stretch the comeback which took the major indices out of correction could be evidence that the sell off probably didn t reflect panic except for a frantic minutes before the close one day last week but instead might have been many people taking profits and maybe looking for their next opportunity pretty much everything moved in an orderly way downward except for that one afternoon and the orderly selling and the quick snap back this week could indicate that people in general didn t give up on the market however a word of caution this rally has been very quick and the markets aren t far now from where they were when all this craziness started for long term investors it s arguably more important than ever to have a plan and stick to it before buying a company at what might look like a bargain price consider asking yourself if the company s fundamentals have changed and whether buying its shares fit into your plan going forward these are weeks when it can really help to have a game plan and not get sucked in by the minute to minute fluctuations crude leaks to seven month lows meanwhile crude got hammered with u s futures hitting their lowest level since april on thursday to close at a barrel that s down from above a month ago climbing u s stockpiles and rising production from saudi arabia and russia all could be playing into this and demand fears amid widespread declines in world stock markets also could be a factor in other commodity news gold moved higher thursday perhaps because some investors see it as an inflation hedge the gold rally aligned with the dollar pulling back from recent yearly highs perhaps in part because some investors seem to have started to reverse the risk off attitude they d taken as stocks plunged last month over in the data department october u s auto sales drifted in throughout thursday from various companies with fiat chrysler nyse fcau enjoying a strong resurgence and toyota reporting slight gains but ford nyse f reporting a drop from a year earlier one thing that seemed pretty clear looking across the spectrum was continued strength in the suv market but falling demand for sedans in other earnings news after the close kraft heinz nasdaq khc shares plunged in post market trading after the company missed wall street analysts earnings estimate while starbucks nasdaq sbux shares steamed higher after beating estimates before friday s open exxon mobil nyse xom shares rose on solid earnings for the huge energy company figure dollar dozes after a steady ride higher over the last couple of weeks that took it to new highs for the year above the dollar index retreated the last two days perhaps in part because some investors started to cut back on their risk off pose adopted during the stock market sell off gold purple line initially weakened this week as the dollar kept climbing but might have gotten a boost thursday from the dollar s struggles and as investors could be looking to hedge inflation data sources ice nyse ice cme group nasdaq cme chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results getting things done more good economic tidings this week came in the form of improved u s productivity in productivity rose the government said and productivity was upwardly revised to that s quite a jump from the anemic growth in and which essentially was zero generally improved productivity tends to characterize a quicker growing more dynamic

helped lead to rapid growth it s really tailed off since then and now a quarter with like looks very strong compared with trend which has been barely above the last few years the uptick in productivity was the result of output increasing and hours worked increasing briefing com noted what might help push productivity into a prolonged upswing one analyst on cnbc suggested thursday that

forget the fed with all the ruckus this morning about employment it s easy to forget that there s a fed meeting next week at this point the futures market projects about a chance of the fed leaving rates alone at this particular meeting but an chance that rates will go up by the end of the year one interesting note is that this is going to be the last fed meeting without an accompanying press conference the fed announced earlier this year that there would be a press conference at every meeting starting in as always next week s meeting will be followed by a statement in its last statement

some time because when it acquired whatsapp facebook was in the process of moving instagram in house facebook also reportedly takes time with these things possibly to ensure that the transition is smooth this isn t necessarily a negative for ibm cloud services because it was an inevitable thing but it is something of a blow for its infrastructure services revenue as the market is very

front as june the day toshiba will decide a winning bidder draws close first foxconn said that apple and amazon were joining its effort to buy toshiba s stake in its jv with western digital then

california and will be followed up with rigs test vehicles will reportedly be on the road in arizona later this year the excitement with trucks is probably related to the dynamics of the trucking

seconds and directs users to places like apple s app store or google s play store where they can listen to the whole track later but despite the billion times the app has been downloaded the company

and self driving cars it also enables apple s face id technology that s part of its iphone x finisar has said that apple s contribution which comes from a billion dollar fund it set aside for u s manufacturing support is not in the nature of a debt or equity investment but instead represents anticipated future business between the companies over a period of time vcsel products are currently in short supply with the main providers being finisar lumentum and oclaro where oclaro is the smallest and lumentum the leader but finisar has been gearing up to increase production manifold it s unclear at this stage whether apple s agreement with finisar involves the purchase of its entire production which would preclude the company from supplying to android manufacturers like samsung ks etc thus giving apple a competitive edge but apple no doubt secured the deal at very favorable rates as it usually does with its component suppliers so it looks like a good deal for apple and an average one for finisar because apple supply agreements usually mean good volumes at very low profit margins toshiba wdc are friends again toshiba and western digital have agreed to settle all disputes between

objections to a takeover of qualcomm nasdaq qcom by broadcom nasdaq avgo they have said that broadcom has a history of cutting cost rather than investing in innovation that could hurt their own expansion plans microsoft is currently working on arm based windows pcs that could for the first time help it diversify away from the architecture any scale back from qualcomm s side could impact this strategy most of google s android devices use qualcomm chips so it could also be affected by the deal the other reason is that broadcom is cozy with prime competitor apple which could make matters worse for them regulators often collect feedback from the industry to better understand the situation before a deal is approved so this objection could get in the way but qualcomm has reportedly asked companies to shelve public statements to see if broadcom raises the offer significantly from the current a share if that isn t forthcoming there could be more press and publicity on the matter seagate job cuts seagate has announced yet another job cut as it continues to struggle against the onslaught of flash memory technology that continues to eat into the hdd market that it has dominated for

pmp that seeks to increase taxes on a growing number of smartphone components to force domestic production apple has held that such imports are necessary at least at the start if its indian operations

      "['this week over of s p companies are set to release their third quarter earnings reports and one of the most noteworthy firms on this list of giants is the largest semiconductor maker in the world intel nasdaq intc investors will want to pay close attention to intel when it reports its third quarter earnings on thursday as its results could underscore the growth of several major tech sector trends the company is currently a zacks rank strong buy and sports an overall vgm grade of b and though shares of intel have gained only this year which is less than the s p and well below the industry s average gain the stock does currently rest firmly near its week high these lofty heights can be attributed to intel s climb over the last weeks including a nearly gain in the last month alone however nvidia nasdaq nvda amd nasdaq amd and other semiconductor companies have helped to curb intel s sector wide dominance in we expect intel to post earnings of cents per share and revenues of billion based on our latest consensus estimates and intense competition among the top semiconductor players is part of the reason for these relatively flat projections yet for the full year intel is expected to post earnings growth of and revenue growth of this should be good news for investors but as we know revenue and earnings are not the only things that matter more detailed dives into intel s third quarter are needed in order to gain a better understanding of the company s current strength this is where we can check our exclusive non financial metrics estimates file to help determine how some of intel s specific divisions including its vitally important data center group are expected to perform these important stock drivers are from our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file these estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts intel s data center business accounts for nearly half of the company s operating margin the company expects data center segment revenue which includes cloud computing and large servers will grow through based on our current consensus estimates we expect intel s data center group revenues will climb over in from billion to billion the company s enterprise focused segment has grown as the demand for data storage and high performance networks has increased exponentially as the number of smartphones and internet connected devices grows coupled with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing intel s data center business will expand and our current growth projection for this large business segment should make many investors very happy for more stock moving estimates ahead of intel s report check out our full guide and make sure to check

further into the busiest stretch of the earnings season investors are starting to turn their attention to the upcoming report from intel nasdaq intc the largest semiconductor company in the world this chip making behemoth will release its third quarter financial results on thursday october the semiconductor industry has been red hot in especially as demand from emerging markets like cloud computing and the internet of things continues to heat up however intel shares which are up on the year have lagged the industry s gains intel s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with the chipmaker s competition recently intel has felt pressure from the likes of nvidia nasdaq nvda and advanced micro devices nasdaq amd nvidia s artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming ai industry while amd has doubled down on its server chips and both of these companies compete with intel in the ever important gaming segment but have nvidia and amd done enough to put a dent in intel s upcoming earnings report well one approach to answering this question is to focus on intel s core business segments luckily by using our exclusive non financial metrics estimates file we can gauge analyst sentiment and predict the company s performance in its key units these important stock driving estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts because of nvidia and amd s popularity in the gaming market we might expect to see an impact in intel s client computing group this business segment includes the company s products designed for notebooks and desktops so it could certainly feel the effects of these gaming friendly chipmakers according to our latest consensus estimates the client computing group is expected to post revenues of billion which would represent a slump of about from the billion posted in the year ago period still while this dip could imply that intel is losing some market share in the personal computing space the company has made some strides in this area recently for example intel recently launched its eighth generation core processors which should lift the company s gaming endeavors and on top of this the client computing group has been a surprise performer for intel this year in fact in the second quarter intel posted revenues of billion in this unit that results smashed our consensus estimate of billion and marked year over year growth of nearly heading into its report intel is sporting a zacks rank strong buy the stock also has a positive earnings esp of so we can feel more confident about the company s chance at an earnings beat

is down over in this morning s trade causing the broader semi category to open lower intel the largest semiconductor company in the us is preparing to release its september quarter earnings thursday october after the bell zacks consensus estimates are showing an eps of on revenues of billion which would represent a decline in both eps and revenues intel is a relatively big mover on earnings and recently that has been to the downside this stock has rallied into and earnings only to fall in the month following the results keep that in mind in anticipation of this upcoming report intel has beaten eps estimates for every quarter since and rarely do they miss revenue it appears the largest driver for this company on earnings reports is forward guidance due to the significant cyclicality in the semiconductor space cpu battlethe fight for cpu market share is flaring between semiconductor powerhouses intel and advanced micro devices intel has been the industry leader in pc and server cpus for years but recent execution issues have allowed amd to come in and swooped up the free market share if you are a big pc gamer or computer whiz i am sure you are more than familiar with the differences between intel and amd chips and likely have an opinion on the quality price mix for the laymen a cpu stands for a central processing unit and is effectively the brain of a computer server this technology is continuously advancing with the year old moore s law still being relevant today gordon moore one of the co founders of intel stated that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every years while the cost is cut in half which means that computers will continue to become exponentially faster and more efficient while at the same time cheaper moore s law still holds today the number of transistors on a microchip depends on the size of the transistor nodes which halve every few years amd has started shipping node cpus while intel is struggling to unveil its chips which have experienced excessive delays intel originally intended to ship its chips back in but had issues on its node chips an atom is to nanometers nm to put into perspective the atomic level in which this is measured intel s recent production issues and delays in next generation cpus have allowed amd to pounce and take a substantial amount of market share intel had been dominating the cpu market for years but recent events have allowed amd to take market share with their ability to not only create the highest performing cpu but at a lower price point currently intel controls of the cpu market while amd has been able to take a share from the less than it controlled a couple of years ago intel doesn t work with the world s foundry tsmc for its cpu innovation and production which is setting them behind the curve tsmc is partnered with amd to surpass the cpu giant and they seem to have a competitive advantage tsmc is in the process of developing transistor chips which will be in production by next year intel says it will have chips by and now this timeline may be pushed back intel may be forced to work with tsmc to remain competitive in the cpu space shift to data centricintel is in the midst of a transformation from a pc centric company to a data centric one nearly half of their growing revenue is now being driven by data centric revenue streams which expanded this past fiscal year intel s total accessible market tam grew to more than billion through acquisitions and product innovations the business is committed to continue investing and developing their cloud computing ai analytics along with the rest of their portfolio the pc business remains intel s biggest topline driver but this business is both mature and overly competitive intel is going to have to rely on its data centric businesses for growth moving forward the data centric business is facing competition for the increasingly powerful gpu which nvidia has proven to be effective in data centers gpu s speed and functionality are slowly surpassing that of cpu s but today they work together to create the most propitious computer power take awayintel is falling behind the curve and it appears this may be a trend moving forward as its competitors broaden their competitive moat intel is still a force to be reckoned with in the cpu market but it will continue to lose market share if it is not able to step
