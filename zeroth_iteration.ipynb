trading but is the stock a buy at these levels let s find out the share price has increased over the past month compared to the the s p has however has grown much slower at over the past year the s p has gained steadily to trade close to its week high but nvidia shares have been far more volatile significantly its median value of is higher than the s p s although both nvda and the s p are currently trading considerably higher than their median levels the industry has a much lower median value although it is currently trading closer to its week high these comparisons seem to indicate that there is room for further upside in nvda shares p ethe forward months price to earnings ratio for nvda is currently compared to the s p average of and the industry average of the high low and median values are also higher moreover the trend lines indicate that nvda is clearly overvalued both with respect to the s p and the industry p sthe trailing months price to sales ratio tells the same story the p s ratio for nvda is currently which is higher than the s p s but much lower than the x industry s the median of is slightly ahead of the s p s and the industry s the highs and lows also indicate that nvda is overvalued both with respect to the s p and the industry p cfin terms of cash flow nvda s valuation of is much higher than the s p s and the industry s moreover the highs lows and median values are also much higher look at its peers while advanced micro devices is nvidia s closest competitor when it comes to gpus intel is the one that it is increasingly pitted against as both companies look for growth in the data center self driving cars and other iot so let s compare the two first intel s current p e based on forward months earnings is just its price to sales ratio is and its price to cash flow is so nvda is obviously overvalued compared to intel a comparison with another semiconductor company texas instruments shows that this chipmaker has a p e based on forward months earnings of a price to sales ratio of and a price to cash flow of here too nvda looks overvalued conclusionit s true that nvda has a solid pipeline that should continue to generate strong growth for years to come but given the strong competition from companies like intel and ongoing consolidation in the space it could soon see many other competitors so the high valuation with respect to the s p the industry in which it operates and a couple of its semiconductor peers is good reason for caution or at least it s good reason to go for intel or texas instruments instead both these companies have a zacks rank strong buy you can see that s better than the zacks rank buy assigned to nvidia more stock news this is bigger than the iphone it could become the mother of all technological revolutions apple nasdaq aapl sold a mere billion iphones in years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than billion devices in just years creating a trillion market zacks

for information about the performance numbers displayed in this press release', 'the semiconductor industry is made up of sub sectors including for semiconductor equipment within the technology sector which is one of the broad zacks categorized sectors similar to the technology sector zacks also breaks down each of the other sectors into groups such that there are a total of sub sectors or industries these industries are then ranked based on the average rank of companies comprising the industry therefore the zacks industry rank is a very good indicator of investment opportunities within an industry at any given time moreover because stocks in the same industry have certain common positive or negative factors affecting them it has been observed that even companies with a neutral zacks rank when part of an industry with a positive outlook will perform better than similar ranked stocks in industries with neutral or negative outlooks for this purpose zacks methodology says that theoutlook for industries positioned or lower is positive between and is neutral and and higher is negative as evident from the table below seven of the semiconductor segments are now in positive territory five are neutral and the rest negative note stocks mentioned in the our picks column is based on the individual ranks of stocks zacks rank for individual stocks denotes strong buy is buy means hold sell and strong sell earnings trends at a glance one of the main factors driving the zacks rank for individual stocks is earnings results therefore it makes sense to take a look at how those have been from the latest we see that of technology stocks have reported with results trailing the s p overall technology stocks earnings were up from the year ago quarter on flattish revenue down also beat earnings estimates and an equal percentage beat revenue expectations major drivers this section can be divided into the current and emerging drivers but before getting into that it s important to understand the backdrop this includes a shrinking traditional market mainly pcs that still consumes the bulk of chips as well as several emerging categories that have extremely strong growth potential this means that while the industry as a whole may appear sluggish there are solid opportunities waiting to be picked current drivers as far as current drivers are concerned the most significant are cloud computing big data and artificial intelligence that are increasing demand for servers and data centers exponentially intel and nvidia nvda are the strongest positioned here with intel s strength mainly on the enterprise side and nvidia s on the hpc side intel intc is trying to challenge nvidia but that is easier said than done hpc is where a lot of the innovation is going on and nvidia is set to pick up share of spending because of its lead in machine learning but of course it won t be alone here intel has plans to get in the game with the technology it acquired through nervana systems both companies are working on hybrid solutions because gpus do a better job of processing the huge amounts of data to train a neural network while cpus do a better job of applying that data to a given situation xilinx nasdaq xlnx is another important player working with fpgas on top of arm based chips some disruption is afoot in the enterprise segment as well because of the work done by the open compute project ocp that facebook nasdaq fb founded and continues to feed the social networking company generates huge volumes of data that it needs to store manage and process as quickly and cost efficiently as possible others with similar interest like apple aapl microsoft msft and google nasdaq googl and differing interest like intel hp cisco csco and juniper are also part of the project facebook designs the chip that is then optimized by the ocp so it becomes something members can standardize on so far so good but if the ocp is able to design chips that perform better or comparably with intel chips the chip maker s cloud business can be hurt this explains why intel is part of the effort but intel has other challengers too google seems to be testing out international business machines ibm new chip designs it is reportedly the only top chip buyer that doesn t sell servers but instead builds them for internal use therefore google s decisions are significant in the chip consumption context google has done two things in the past that could be viewed as second sourcing or maybe creating leverage against intel to pressure it into lowering prices the company has declared that everything it now does also supports ibm s power systems and it is also in talks with qualcomm nasdaq qcom that could result in its using some of its arm based server chips amazon nasdaq amzn is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure followed by microsoft ibm and google this is another chip hungry segment with long term demand for the devices this is perhaps the reason that some time back amazon started dabbling with low end arm chips the company looks interested in making its own devices but it s still too early to comment on its progress meanwhile google is testing ibm and arm technology while microsoft is collaborating with qualcomm to use arm technology in its internal servers it is probably only a matter of time before intel sees notable competition intel s only course of action is to innovate around the problem increasing performance while reducing cost per watt is a way it could do this after all it s hard to convince people that you deserve to make a nice margin another significant development is intel s decision to license arm technology perhaps to support its foundry business or help it speed up its iot effort or maybe even to use in some segments of the cloud computing market another important segment for semiconductor companies that is relatively low key is industrial since semiconductors facilitate increased automation on the factory floor they are increasingly used to drive efficiency and lower cost reportedly pricewaterhousecoopers pwc expects the industrial semiconductor market to grow at a cagr compounded annual growth rate of between and a global industry analysts gia report says that the u s is the largest market for industrial semiconductors although the asia pacific is the fastest growing on account of its being a manufacturing hub the overall market is expected to be worth billion by ic insights estimates that global medical semiconductor sales will grow at a cagr to reach billion in it s not clear if this estimate includes wearables that are normally considered iot and therefore included in consumer wearables carry an increasing amount of medical information and consume a good number of semiconductor devices databeans attributes continued strength in this vertical to the need to reduce healthcare cost expected to double from the current trillion over the next few years the need to extend healthcare to underserved areas and convenience the need to improve overall disease management from the comfort of your own home one of the fastest growing emerging markets for semiconductor devices is automotive as the consumption of electronic components for safety infotainment navigation and fuel efficiency continues to increase a recent report from marketsandmarkets says that the automotive semiconductor market will grow at a cagr of from through power components like mosfet and igbt devices are some of the fastest growing because of the increased electrification of vehicles the growing middle class in several asian markets like china india thailand indonesia and malaysia is greatly increasing the demand for passenger cars thus accounting for most of the semiconductor shipments into the automotive market semiconductor consumption in this market was worth around billion in according to reportlinker primary areas of strength were hybrid electric vehicles telematics and connectivity and advanced driver assistance systems adas where the estimated year cagrs for chip demand are and respectively infineon stmicroelectronics renesas which acquired intersil texas instruments txn analog devices adi and cypress are important players qualcomm after its acquisition of nxp semiconductor which itself acquired freescale semiconductor has become a major player in automotive semiconductors similar to medical devices the auto market also has an emerging adjacent market in the form of autonomous self driving cars that will consume a huge number of semiconductors particularly the sensors processors and other technology enabling the vehicles wireless infrastructure builds have been necessitated by increasing data volumes and connectivity issues network congestion power reliability privacy and security in wireless networks these builds will require increased investment in semiconductors thus driving sales new materials a compound of two or more are being used in this segment with galium nitride gaining share of rf high power semiconductors according to abi research according to strategy analytics the greatest driver of these compound semiconductors is the convergence of voice video and data networks that is leading to the explosive growth of data traffic across wireless devices within fixed and wireless networks in driver assistance systems in network centric battlefield philosophies solid state lighting and high power electronics the firm expects compound semiconductor revenue to grow at a compounded average annual growth rate caagr to double revenue to billion by the pc market still consumes a large number of chips but its importance as a driver continues to decline that s because the market itself is shrinking gartner estimates that it declined in the third quarter while idc estimates that it declined idc believes that north america grew for the second straight quarter while gartner says that sales were consistent with year ago periods both agree on declines in the asia pacific consumers are hesitant to spend on upgrades given that they already have many more devices than they need developed markets and because internet and many other conveniences of computers are now easily available on smartphones and tablets emerging markets but gaming enthusiasts demand stronger and faster machines which is the main driver of pc sales and chips right now in either case it s very clear that the steady growth seen in yesteryears is history idc for one expects the pc market to shrink in so semiconductor players with pc market exposure can at best profit from market share gains byod exposure and increased exposure to the top pc vendors which are lenovo hp dell asus and apple according to both idc and gartner apple makes its own pcs software and also a lot of its own processors relying largely on intel qualcomm and samsung ks for its other semiconductor requirements microsoft makes software and limited quantities of hardware relying largely on third party device makers for chips pcs and mobile devices it s also a major player in the cloud which makes it an important ally for semiconductor companies like intel qualcomm or nvidia alphabet s chromebooks on the other hand are made by a number of hardware makers that use either intel or arm technology emerging drivers traditionally the consumer technology market included smartphones tablets and electronic gadgets like lcd tvs and blu ray players but that is changing as we speak with the consumer technology association cta formerly called consumer electronics association cea estimating that u s consumer technology retail sales will be driven by iot this year to touch billion moreover these traditional segments are expected to decline this year with their contribution dropping to less than of total sales for the first time next year smartphones tablets and tvs are mature categories with shipments expected to grow a respective and laptops will decline the estimated growth rate for hybrids convertibles and detachables wasn t refreshed so assuming it remains at of the emerging technology categories ultra hd tvs will grow wearables will grow fitness trackers up smart watches up smart home encompassing products like thermostats smart smoke and detectors ip wi fi cameras smart locks smart home systems and smart switches dimmers and outlets will grow drones will grow vr voice activated digital assistants like amazon s echo and printing most of the emerging technology categories fall in the category more commonly referred to as internet of things iot a recent mckinsey report says that the installed base of iot devices was in the range of billion at end and is expected to increase by about annually over the next few years to billion units by ic insights estimates that iot semiconductor sales will increase in to billion and will grow at a cagr of from to for the firm expects iot semiconductor revenue growth in smart cities of to billion connected vehicles to million wearables to billion connected homes to million and industrial internet chip to billion however despite the strong revenue prospects this is still a nascent market with several challenges to its continued growth these would be security privacy because of the huge amount of data generated and collected still limited availability of consistent standards enabling interoperability relatively low roi for chipmakers necessitating the integration of additional technology or the final product by the chipmaker and the possibility of a growing number of niche products companies are doubling down on these challenges for instance freescale now part of nxp is part of the embedded microprocessor benchmarking consortium eembc to identify embedded security gaps and set guidelines for iot manufacturers to make more secure devices also both intel and arm now acquired by softbank have increased focus on security intel is working on building chip level security while also facilitating security in the cloud through the mcafee data exchange layer in arm s case the company acquired israeli startup sansa which offers both hardware security technology and software for advanced socs used in the iot market the company will likely build some security features into its designs on the standardization front companies like intel ibm cisco ge and at t nyse t have formed the industrial internet consortium to develop common standards the process could take time but once available the standards could generate higher margin revenue for semiconductor players there will however be increased scrutiny on privacy considerations component forecast the semiconductor industry association sia estimates that semiconductor sales in were up from levels versus expectations of a increase logic memory and micro ics were the top three segments sensors and actuators was the fastest growing

manufacturing company nyse tsm here are highlights from wednesday s analyst blog how are semiconductor companies doing this quarter semiconductor stocks have been mixed so far and a broader cyclical slowdown seems apparent from the results most players aren t expecting a protracted downturn mainly because the rollout is coming sooner than expected because auto content adds are continuing and other secular drivers like artificial intelligence ai and internet of things iot remain ongoing drivers additionally technology transition to smaller nodes is a positive for equipment companies the possibility of a u s china trade war remains a shadow for longer term prospects but this isn t a negative in the near term as it can only lead to inventory adds at customers read on for the details intelbarely topped expectations for the quarter helped by the client computing group iotg and mobileye f most disappointing was the weakness in data center where intel will also see market share loss

straight quarterly decline in what looks like a semiconductor down cycle management helpfully commented that historically semi down cycles were a four to five quarter affair after which year on year growth usually returned still as experts and analysts have been commenting on for long there remain several secular drivers for this industry for ti the silver lining was communications infrastructure where deployment led to growth the core auto and industrial markets where most of its resources are parked benefit from increasing content per unit although overall weakness is perceivable at this point its personal communications business is feeling the pain from a sluggish smartphone market especially lower than expected business from apple so net net the all important analog business that makes up of its revenue was down a moderate while embedded processing revenue share declined margins were of course impacted by the lower utilization rate that s despite the fact that ti outsources some stuff mainly in the embedded unit and cuts those outside orders before reducing production at internal fabs the company continues to return all of its fcf to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases numbers eps of topped the zacks consensus estimate of reported revenue of billion was higher than the zacks consensus estimate of billion the zacks consensus estimate for grew

the benefit of ongoing share repurchases lower wfe spending in the mid to high teens percent range driven by inventory burn at nand and dram customers is expected to continue through the year this will be offset by strength at foundry and logic customers ramping leading edge nodes faster than expected foundry in particular was very strong in the last quarter overall lam is strongly positioned by virtue of its product range that facilitates technology conversion at the front end so the advent of ai and iot are expanding the served available market while strength in china which is now a

consensus estimate for grew to in the last days the shares carry a zacks rank hold taiwan semiconductor manufacturing companyreported a weak quarter as a global slowdown especially in smartphones consequent inventory buildup at customers and a photoresist contamination at one of its fabs combined to pull down results u s china trade war related concerns was likely an offsetting factor as it would normally cause chinese customers to stock pile what follows from the above situation is a reduction in utilization which along with low margins impacts profitability note that the contaminated product will ship this quarter helping numbers also full year gross margin guidance of was reiterated as tsm expects strong utilization in the second half but the main question for investors is the extent of the slowdown and the factors that will play a role in pulling it out management said that channel inventories will largely be burnt down especially at important customers like nvidia nasdaq nvda by the middle of the year which makes for a stronger second half so hpc ai will come back soon the sooner than expected rollout in asia and apple s truce with qualcomm that will further boost adoption makes another strong driver of growth iot and automotive applications are other expected drivers tsm snatched the process lead from intel and is already working on and while shipping and in volume this makes it the go to place for fabless semiconductor players the capex target is being maintained at billion so the company will spend as necessary to maintain its process lead its client roster includes companies like nvidia apple qualcomm and amd that are all at the leading edge of technology all except amd are also market leaders this positions it very well to benefit from any semiconductor upcycle it also positions it to benefit from their new product rollouts this is especially true because of the cyclical slowdown in semiconductors which could extend for quarters more so new products from customers and shipping to consumption are important factors likely to help tsm numbers the zacks consensus estimate for remains unchanged at after it was lowered by cents days ago

on alibaba nyse baba here is a synopsis of all three stocks i last wrote about nvidia as the bull of the day in mid november after another strong quarterly report instead of sustaining new highs above shares fell nearly to support under as the semiconductor group acquiesced to extremely overbought conditions and this despite analysts raising nvda s eps estimates from a consensus to with several high end projections near still at that would make nvda trade at times the most optimistic forward estimates and so nervous holders with any profits are quick to run on any excuse we saw that excuse as a great opportunity in early december to add more nvda shares in my portfolio here s what i told my members on december about a potentially fading opportunity to still buy nvda near as i ve written numerous times this is the one to own for ai engines and advanced hpc high performance computing applications nvidia builds systems on a chip soc that are fueling so many different bleeding edge industries from autonomous driving robotics and big data mining to cancer genomic research medical diagnosis and cyber security that all require massively parallel architecture mpa and as the nvidia press page reminds us this week the year in tech wakes up early with the annual international consumer electronics show ces in las vegas on sunday january at when nvidia founder and ceo jensen huang takes the stage to talk about the company s automotive platforms as always we can also expect a flurry of related surprises from nvidia to explain the long tail of nvidia s growth and dominance within and connected to several technology industries let s review what i wrote in mid november is nvda too expensive at but many investors wonder if the stock is still a buy as it now trades for times trailing month earnings as an nvda investor i have a bias that says yes i would still be a buyer near and after this most recent quarterly report as i go over the growth profile in all its different business segments and customers i find multiple reasons to reinforce this view in sum as long as the leading provider of gaming processors high performance computing in data centers and emerging ai technologies keeps delivering solid double digit sales and earnings growth along with upside surprises each quarter then paying times the current projection for next year s profits isn t a bad proposition so two important questions follow will the market demand for hpc ai solutions in data center gaming and automotive segments continue to grow at high double digits can nvidia maintain their dominant position even as intel nasdaq intc buys mobileye otc mbbyf for a foothold in driverless cars and forges a renewed alliance with old arch enemy advanced micro devices nasdaq amd to establish a front in gpu processor markets to help you decide whether the current multiple is too expensive for nvidia s growth this article will go over the current and forecast leadership of nvidia and why some wall street investment banks believe the company is on its way to earning per share in which would equate to a multiple at high street targets near every major dude will tell youin early november i was reviewing all the big announcements at the beijing gpu tech conference in late september in particular that the giants of china e commerce alibaba baidu and tencent were all new cloud datacenter customers i came away with the insight that everybody is their customer now then on monday november from the supercomputing conference in denver nvidia issued a press release highlighting the exact thing nvidia chosen by every major computer maker every major clouddenver nov globe newswire nvidia today announced the world s most advanced data center gpu the nvidia tesla nasdaq tsla gpu based on nvidia s volta architecture is available through every major computer maker and chosen by every major cloud to deliver artificial intelligence and high performance computing dell emc nyse emc hewlett packard enterprise huawei ibm nyse ibm and lenovo have all announced volta based offerings for their customers providers such as alibaba cloud amazon nasdaq amzn web services baidu cloud microsoft nasdaq msft azure oracle nyse orcl cloud and tencent cloud have also announced volta based cloud services building on this breadth of offerings nvidia has introduced new software and tools on the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry that make it easy for scientists to deploy nvidia s accelerated computing platform for compute intensive research end of nvidia press release excerpt while i really like the fact that some of my favorite cloud builders and ai innovators like alibaba and baidu are nvidia customers i am even more impressed that amazon and microsoft are let s explore why volta is nvidia s latest advance in hpc architecture it delivers over teraflops per second tflops of deep learning performance over a increase compared to the prior generation nvidia pascal architecture it s important to understand that nvidia doesn t just make hpc parallel processing chips for gaming datacenter ai and other applications the gpu chips with thousands of cores come embedded in some version of an overall platform known as cuda compute unified device architecture which allows developers to immediately begin programming in a common language say c what they want the machine learning system to do so the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry adds a new level of service and ease of use for corporations applying the technology in short nvidia has just outdone themselves again in winning over the developer and enterprise communities by creating an extended platform which simplifies software integrations deep learning is nvidia s businessstick with me on mapping who nvidia s customers are and just as importantly why they are if you understand this end demand for the technology from the who s who of big tech companies you will better appreciate the potential value of nvidia s growth segments and the coming explosion of ai applications that i am going to describe for you in the last two sections so how does nvidia speak to both individual developers and massive enterprises after they build a cuda architecture they make sure that data scientists entrepreneurs and organizations can use it in may the company announced that their deep learning institute was expanding the number and availability of programming courses at little or no cost with the goal of training developers by the end of and on october nvidia announced immediate availability of the nvidia gpu cloud ngc container registry for ai developers worldwide here was the word from that pr in just a few steps ngc helps developers get started with deep learning development through no cost access to a comprehensive easy to use fully optimized deep learning software stack the cloud based service is available immediately to users of the just announced amazon elastic compute cloud amazon instances featuring nvidia tesla gpus nvidia plans to expand support to other cloud platforms soon after signing up for an ngc account developers can download a containerized software stack that integrates and optimizes a wide range of deep learning frameworks nvidia libraries and cuda runtime versions which are kept up to date and run seamlessly in the cloud or on nvidia dgx systems the nvidia gpu cloud democratizes ai for a rapidly expanding global base of users said jim mchugh vice president and general manager of enterprise systems at nvidia ngc frees developers from the complexity of integration allowing them to move quickly to create sophisticated neural networks that deliver the transformative powers of ai end of nvda pr excerpt from oct also at the supercomputing conference in denver where dozens of computer makers and cloud service providers launched a wide range of volta based products and services ceo and nvidia founder jensen huang proudly described what he must regard as their greatest overall achievement volta is the world s most powerful platform for ai and hpc and will allow the world s top minds in scientific research to push the limit on what s possible in areas like drug discovery alternative fuel sources and predicting natural disasters with volta now in data centers and clouds around the world a new wave of innovation is underway that will have an incredible impact across society with every major computer and cloud provider adopting nvidia technology the runway appears clear for continued sales growth over the next years how far will segment growth fly before i break down nvidia s segment growth let me share a few important notes on terminology inference is the term used to describe the next level of machine learning after training inference is sometimes referred to as deep learning after scientists have trained a system on data then they can have it apply the data set and knowledge to learn new things think of the initial training as establishing weights for data baselines and inference as advanced pattern recognition gaming is still nvidia s biggest end market claiming nearly of the company s projected billion in sales this year and still growing at over annually and gaming is still the largest global entertainment industry at over billion in annual sales in september i read several investment bank research reports which indicated that nvidia could continue to grow their cloud datacenter business at over annually for the next years with sales projections ranging from to billion in just for this segment results delivered confirmation of that optimism with volta adoption driving datacenter segment sales to million representing sequential quarter over quarter and annual year over year growth nvda noted that there are now more than companies using its volta based inference platform and this is why many wall street analysts are so enthusiastic about the continued growth in the datacenter space especially since the total addressable market tam is expected to push over billion in the next to years automotive is currently a small sales contributor for nvidia at just under of total revenues but the segment is growing at nearly as nvidia forms key partnerships in europe with bosch and paccar nasdaq pcar and in china with baidu to deliver autonomous driving technology even cryptocurrency mining is a growth category for nvidia although it may never contribute more than of total sales the biggest market yet for ai gpu parallel processing architectures will continue to sweep business away from old line cpu serial processing architectures in the computing market since gaming datacenter automotive and crypto mining are all parallel applications growing strong double digits nvidia has a clear path to double revenues in the next to years but there are advanced computing markets on the horizon that many investors haven t thought much about yet and probably some analysts haven t even incorporated these markets into their models to highlight one of them i ve been in a surreal state of shock since i read a recent bank of america nyse bac research report about augmented reality in it the bofa ml analysts calculate that last year s total market revenues tied to ar were billion in they are forecasting this market to grow to billion that s a

watching more closely than usual simply because the market is on edge about the fed s next move if the numbers on retail sales and housing look strong it could play into thoughts that the fed might not want to get too aggressive lowering rates further it could be another example of good news being bad weekly jobless claims on thursday were better than expected another possible signal of economic health as of late thursday cme futures showed a chance of a rate cut next month but just odds of a basis point cut that might be the percentage to watch as the data come in next week with the majority

gets its share of the pie with cisco nasdaq csco and nvidia nasdaq nvda also due to report next week multinational machinery maker deere nyse de wraps things up next friday though earnings have generally exceeded expectations one thing we haven t seen much is stronger guidance this could be because many companies feel cautious about getting too optimistic due to the trade situation and apparent slump in global economies retailers could be especially interesting to watch on guidance especially with the holiday shopping season just a few months away sector reversal as cyclicals shined thursdayfrom a sector perspective some of the same areas that got pounded earlier this week threw a party on thursday semiconductors part of the technology sector were especially strong as advanced micro devices nasdaq amd rolled up double digit gains after the company released the second generation of its processor chip for data centers and said that it had landed googl and twitter nyse twtr as customers reuters reported financials got some of their mojo back as rates rose and energy also had a comeback thanks in part to a rally in crude which seems to be continuing to strengthen this morning defensive sectors utilities and staples brought up the rear but generally it was hard to find anything to complain about for the bulls for the moment cyclicals seem to be back in vogue but it s going to be interesting to see if it can stay that way if bonds start rallying again speaking of which both gold and bonds recovered some territory late thursday from earlier lows that could reinforce feelings that we re far from out of the woods which is true enough one thing to consider watching today is whether investors feel they can enter the weekend without taking some of thursday s

closed below in nearly a year or above in more than two years however the dollar remains more robust than many people might have gotten used to during the era when it mostly traded below so today s levels might seem challenging to companies selling products overseas you d think the dollar might come under more pressure due to expectations for fed rate cuts but with central banks around the world cutting already and the u s economy among the strongest it s hard to envision the dollar falling too much despite the president s hopes need money if you re the parent of a college student it s the time of year when those scary tuition bills could appear in the mail any day or maybe they have already and they re sitting on the counter waiting for you to open them some investors might be at the point where they need to cash out of a stock position to pay the bill but might be hesitant to sell with the market so jumpy for investors who need money for college or some other major payment it might be worth considering selling your position over a period of several days rather than all at once that way if things whiplash quickly you might come out at a decent average maybe one third today one third next week and so on of course that would mean extra trading costs a possible negative element to doing things in thirds or fourths good trading', 'friday market open the u s jobs machine kept humming along in october despite a soft stock market creating jobs to far exceed wall street analysts expectations at the same time hourly pay rose the biggest jump in almost a decade and one that could conceivably bring inflation fears back into play this looks like another great jobs report the gain in payrolls easily surpassed the average estimate heading into the report while the pay gains met expectations the labor department also made some minor revisions to past jobs reports lowering september s gain to from but raising august growth to a massive the unemployment rate stayed unchanged in october at a near year low of the hourly wage increase of compared with recent gains of just below so on its face it s not a huge change but investors sometimes pay more attention to big round numbers so there could be a psychological effect to seeing the increase rise above earlier this year a rise sent some investors scurrying for cover amid concerns that higher wages might throw the market into a wage price inflationary cycle that could bring the fed in to clamp down on any possible overheating the same concerns might start creeping in now and chances of a fed rate hike by the end of the year inched higher soon after the data right after friday s report the major indices appeared to hold close to where they d been a few minutes before in pre market trading with the dow jones industrial average dji still pointing to possible point gains after the open in part on optimism about china trade see more below while nasdaq composite comp slumped slightly in part due to disappointment over apple s nasdaq aapl results see more below looking a little deeper into the data leisure and hospitality added the most jobs with and healthcare added but manufacturing and construction which tend to be hallmarks of a booming economy also posted solid gains of and respectively other areas with decent gains included transportation and warehousing and business and professional services it s hard to find anything wrong with this report which showed job creation rising for the consecutive month and continued stellar numbers out of the health care sector the only place where things might have gotten a little overblown was leisure and hospitality which may have seen some pent up demand due to the hurricane earlier this fall under the peel apple earnings as always had the potential to either slow the market s momentum or help put more wind at its back this time the company s results seemed to bring some bears out of the woods as shares sank more than in pre market trading if this holds up it would be the biggest single day decline in aapl shares in more than two years in a nutshell apple s results were certainly not a disaster the quarter had its low and high points but investors seemed to focus at least initially on the disappointing ones though aapl beat third party consensus estimates for both earnings per share and revenue iphone unit sales of million were a bit shy of wall street s estimates the average selling prices for the iphone on the other hand rose to up from the previous quarter and beating factset s estimate of around disappointment seemed to center on the iphone unit sales number and the company s fiscal guidance of billion to billion which was just below the average analyst estimate of billion looking at things from a high level the average selling price gain could be seen as healthy because it might send the message that aapl s higher priced phones are gaining traction with its customer base however the miss on iphone unit sales could indicate that people are waiting longer to replace their old phones not such a good development as for the guidance aapl has often been conservative on its guidance but some investors might have wanted to see aapl projecting a blowout holiday quarter especially after the disappointing holiday quarter guidance from amazon nasdaq amzn last week it also may disappoint some investors to hear that aapl won t break out iphone unit volume in its earnings any more the street doesn t tend to like when companies cut back on what investors see as an important number for guidance lots of companies don t report product unit sales but the iphone arguably isn t just any product china fortunes keep swaying market to get a sense of just how large u s china trade issues loom going into the meeting between the country s leaders later this month consider the action in stocks thursday morning things were chugging along a little higher before a tweet from president trump in which he said he d had a productive conversation with chinese president xi the dji quickly scampered to point gains even though the tweet lacked much detail then early friday stock futures jumped to more big gains after what sounded like encouraging words from president xi on state television according to media reports the point gain in djia futures seemed to come based just on the two leaders comments with no details offered about what kind of agreement might be in store or when it could be reached those gains got pared in the hour ahead of the opening bell after cnbc reported an administration official saying there s a long way to go to reach a deal stocks overseas particularly in asia had risen overnight in part on the trade rumored detente xi and trump are scheduled to meet at the group of buenos aires summit nov dec so investors might want to consider staying tuned for any previews of that the threat of u s tariffs on an additional billion in chinese goods could be one factor that continues to keep the market slightly in check until investors have a better sense of whether these trade issues can get resolved recent economic data from china have been mixed and the u s administration says nothing is set in stone on whether those additional tariffs will take effect media reports said to sum up there s probably no issue right now as close to the minds of most investors as trade with china even the u s midterms arguably don t seem to have as much force this remains one reason why it s probably safe to say that volatility doesn t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon three in a row before aapl and payrolls the stock market posted its third straight day of healthy gains thursday the dow jones industrial average dji has gained points over this stretch the comeback which took the major indices out of correction could be evidence that the sell off probably didn t reflect panic except for a frantic minutes before the close one day last week but instead might have been many people taking profits and maybe looking for their next opportunity pretty much everything moved in an orderly way downward except for that one afternoon and the orderly selling and the quick snap back this week could indicate that people in general didn t give up on the market however a word of caution this rally has been very quick and the markets aren t far now from where they were when all this craziness started for long term investors it s arguably more important than ever to have a plan and stick to it before buying a company at what might look like a bargain price consider asking yourself if the company s fundamentals have changed and whether buying its shares fit into your plan going forward these are weeks when it can really help to have a game plan and not get sucked in by the minute to minute fluctuations crude leaks to seven month lows meanwhile crude got hammered with u s futures hitting their lowest level since april on thursday to close at a barrel that s down from above a month ago climbing u s stockpiles and rising production from saudi arabia and russia all could be playing into this and demand fears amid widespread declines in world stock markets also could be a factor in other commodity news gold moved higher thursday perhaps because some investors see it as an inflation hedge the gold rally aligned with the dollar pulling back from recent yearly highs perhaps in part because some investors seem to have started to reverse the risk off attitude they d taken as stocks plunged last month over in the data department october u s auto sales drifted in throughout thursday from various companies with fiat chrysler nyse fcau enjoying a strong resurgence and toyota reporting slight gains but ford nyse f reporting a drop from a year earlier one thing that seemed pretty clear looking across the spectrum was continued strength in the suv market but falling demand for sedans in other earnings news after the close

more good economic tidings this week came in the form of improved u s productivity in productivity rose the government said and productivity was upwardly revised to that s quite a jump from the anemic

briefing com noted what might help push productivity into a prolonged upswing one analyst on cnbc suggested thursday that freer global trade and more innovation from the technology sector might help a challenge he added is that much of the technology sector is now concentrated in a few large firms which might staunch innovation that said the quarterly numbers could remain interesting to watch in the months ahead to see if this mini rally can continue semiconductors recharge one interesting thing about the rally over the last three days is how semiconductors a sector that got taken to the woodshed over the last few weeks as the market tumbled revived in a major way just as stocks like nvidia nvda and advanced micro devices nasdaq amd were among the first to get hit really hard in the downturn they were also some of the first to show strength when the market started to turn around this week nvda shares have rallied back from the recent low mark posted monday while amd have come back since that same day the chip makers originally started to sag amid fears of possible declining demand and potential tariff impacts those issues haven t necessarily gone away but it does show the kind of impact geopolitical fears can have on sectors like this one this time the fear might have gotten a bit overdone don t forget the fed with all the ruckus this morning about employment it s easy to forget that there s a fed meeting next week at this point the futures market projects about a chance of the fed leaving rates alone at this particular meeting but an chance that rates will go up by the end of the year one interesting note is that this is going to be the last fed meeting without an accompanying press conference the fed announced earlier this year that there would be a press conference at every meeting starting in as always next week s meeting will be followed by a statement in its last statement back in september the fed cited what it said was strong economic activity and jobs growth with inflation remaining near its target risks to the outlook it said were balanced next wednesday afternoon investors might want to take a close look to see if any of that language evolved td ameritrade commentary for educational purposes only member sipc options involve risks and are not suitable for all investors please read characteristics and risks of standardized options', 'friday market open as the first snowflakes of winter fall in parts of the country friday the stock market also has a chilly tone to start the day concerns about rising rates continue to weigh on sentiment and so does a higher than expected read on u s inflation some investors seem to be seizing on what looked like an unremarkable aspect of the fed s statement yesterday one that was unchanged from the previous meeting the fed said it expects further gradual increases in rates as the economy continues to thrive it s a bit hard to understand any panic about these words because they didn t tell investors anything that most didn t already know still perhaps some people had hoped for a more dovish tone after october s market thrashing and the fed didn t deliver as it is markets fell across europe and asia overnight and pressure might spill over into u s trading speaking of europe there s more drama there as the european commission tangled with italy over the italian government s budget forecasts which the ec said looked too optimistic on deficits moving west debate raged about whether a brexit deal might be getting close and the u k government is holding meetings on the issue this weekend media reports said a brexit breakthrough if it comes might give european markets a boost but it s unclear how close it might be asian markets are on pace to fall for the sixth week out of the last seven back home a slew of fed speakers march out to the microphones today so consider watching for some of their reflections michigan sentiment is also due this morning additionally in a report that might keep the fed on its toes producer prices shot up by in october the biggest monthly climb in six years and way above analyst estimates of higher gas machinery and equipment prices all played a part however it s important to note that core wholesale inflation which strips out volatile energy and food prices rose a little less at and prices over the last year are up below the peak seen last summer with oil now in a tailspin see more below inflationary worries might be lifting in earnings news late thursday disney nyse dis delivered a strong quarter posting earnings per share of and revenue of billion third party consensus was for and billion both parks and resorts and the company s studio entertainment segments performed well and the company predicted an accelerated timeline for its takeover of major assets of century fox inc nasdaq fox according to dis the acquisition could close meaningfully earlier than the mid date it had previously projected the wall street journal reported shares of dis climbed in pre market trading the news didn t look so hot over at activision blizzard nasdaq atvi where shares crumbled in the pre market hours after the company missed analysts earnings expectations and saw active users fall fed reflection thursday saw stocks move a bit lower as the fed held rates steady some of the pressure also might have reflected profit taking after a massive rally wednesday that possibly got a bit overdone also the fed stuck to its position of advocating gradual rate hikes meaning no sign of any end to the steady drip drip of higher rates this is the part that seems to be hurting sentiment early friday the fed s decision likely didn t come as a surprise to many but futures prices still predict around a chance of a fourth rate hike by the end of the year fed chair jerome powell is scheduled to make some public comments next week which could give investors more insight into the fed s current thinking the fed s statement thursday didn t evolve much from its last meeting in september as it did then the fed noted economic activity has been rising at a strong rate and job gains have been strong it added that the unemployment rate has dropped and that household spending has continued to grow strongly fed sees business investment moderating the one significant change was around business investment and that follows what looked like a slowdown in that category in the gross domestic product gdp report issued last month growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year the fed s statement now reads back in september the fed s statement said that the category had grown strongly on the inflation front there was no change to the fed s september prediction that price increases would remain near its target over the next months both for overall inflation and core inflation that strips out food and energy prices the fed arguably finds itself in a tough place as it tries to keep the u s economy from overheating even as it faces pressure not to run the value of the dollar so high through tighter monetary policy that it might hurt foreign countries and keep their consumers from being able to afford u s products remember the fed has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment there are signs that a stronger dollar along with recent trade battles might be hurting u s company outlooks in treasuries the year benchmark yield rose slightly to after the fed statement thursday just a few basis points below last month s highs it was at early friday energy loses steam after oil craters energy shares took the biggest hit thursday falling more than as crude oil entered a bear market see more below the dollar index is also back on the climb moving above thursday after falling below earlier this week hawkish fed policy tends to support a strong dollar and that could be a possible stress factor for some sectors like tech industrials and materials with big foreign markets also the dollar is once again climbing vs the chinese yuan with the psychological yuan to the dollar level not far away financials did appear to get a boost from the fed s continued optimistic tone regarding the economy and topped the sector leaderboard thursday in fact financials are outpacing the broader s p index spx over the last week that s kind of a change of pace but it s not clear if it can hold up bank stocks have declined about so far this year and just haven t been able to get going despite this anticipated higher rate environment the stock market is out of correction but the crude market turned bearish thursday u s futures closed below a barrel on thursday down more than from highs above last month generally a drop from high close to low close defines a bear market by early friday the front month u s contract had fallen to the first time a front month has fallen under since march there hasn t been a close below in nearly nine months so perhaps that s worth watching later today thursday s losses were the ninth consecutive lower session for u s crude futures with oil taking a beating from u s production hitting record highs and saudi arabia and russia also gearing up output the long term impact on the energy sector from all this is too soon to tell one bad month probably isn t going to make that big a difference but extended periods of low oil prices can sometimes hinder energy sector earnings growth as investors might remember from the bear oil market of at that point crude fell as low as a barrel in the u s and many oil companies saw dramatic plunges in their earnings it s way too soon to worry about that now and it s also unlikely crude could fall to such bargain basement levels especially considering how healthy the u s economy is now compared to then figure extra cash for holiday shoppers this one month chart comparing the consumer discretionary sector candlestick to the energy sector purple line shows that discretionary stocks are starting to rally back from october lows even as energy continues to wallow near recent lows cheaper oil is hurting the energy sector but might end up helping discretionary by putting a little

guarantee future results lower gas costs might help shoppers consumer discretionary has had its rally hat on lately ahead of holiday shopping season and gas prices going back below a gallon across much of the country over the last week probably can t hurt this sector lower gas prices might have a psychological impact making shoppers feel like they can spend a bit more on gifts if they re saving at the pump see chart above stay tuned this weekend for an opec meeting some analysts think opec members might start sending signals soon about lowering output in the face of this price pullback but that s not assured others say saudi arabia may be under political pressure to keep the oil flowing after last month s diplomatic dispute with the u s over a missing journalist tech recovery beyond the headlines the faangs get a lot of attention and all five of those closely watched stocks are up significantly from their october lows some have even gained in the double digits however if you re looking for the best performing tech stocks since october s depths you won t find the faangs among them instead tech leaders as of thursday afternoon included semiconductor firm advanced micro devices nasdaq amd up from its october low followed by a gain from cybersecurity company symantec nasdaq symc and a rise from xilinx nasdaq xlnx a supplier of programmable logic devices cnbc noted what this might help show is how varied the tech sector is beyond big names like apple nasdaq aapl ibm nyse ibm and microsoft nasdaq msft from a high level view tech still trails the broader s p spx over the last month this partly reflects how so much selling zeroed in on tech shares during october s shakeout for the year so far tech shares are still up more than compared with less than for the spx but tech s rise this year is way short of the better than gains of consider keeping an eye out for a couple of major tech earnings next week from cisco nasdaq csco and nvidia nasdaq nvda which could give insight into the latest macro developments in those two companies respective industries retail stocks perk up ahead of holidays earnings black friday is just two weeks away less if you factor in that

iphone manufacturing in the u s in june this year apple requested its iphone assemblers pegatron and foxconn to evaluate the feasibility of making the devices in the u s while pegatron refused outright on cost considerations foxconn has decided to do the job the study is likely to show that the cost increase skill mismatch and supply chain problems the supply chain is largely in asia would make this cost prohibitive this would raise iphone prices for consumers squeeze apple s margins but the study will help apple negotiate with the government which might agree to fund skill development and or subsidize u s made phones if not apple could introduce a luxury line of iphones manufactured in the u s and try to set off the super normal profits on those with the increased cost of phones carrying the government import duty note that apple is not the only smartphone maker saddled with the problem so if all smartphones get more expensive apple s market share may not be affected cisco earnings report cisco s first quarter results on both the top and bottom lines but the guidance disappointed switching remains a sore point for cisco in a market increasingly favoring sdn networks and leveraging the cloud so it s not surprising that this segment declined the company had greater success in security where both advanced threat up and web security up were strong intel a i day at its first artificial intelligence ai day in san francisco last week intel announced bold plans to target the deep learning segment that is currently dominated by nvidia nasdaq nvda gpus intel silicon is also in the mix but it doesn t take part in the real training work artificial intelligence comprises two main operations training and inference with training being the more compute intensive inference can be handled by intel cpus xilinx altera fpgas nvidia gpus asics like google nasdaq googl tpu and in some cases dsps now intel is planning to enter the training side very aggressively and hopefully it can stick with the timeline it has set based on its acquisition of startup nervana last year intel is building a new xeon processor with nervana integration fpgas are generally used as accelerators and we don t know yet if intel will be using the fpga technology it got through nervana or altera which it also picked up recently at any rate intel promises to deliver the training speed current gpus offer within three years which industry expert patrick moorhead says is aggressive intel expects the chips to start testing in mid and ship by year end fake news drama facebook nasdaq fb and google are being pressured by mainstream media msm for influencing the public in favor of trump as ridiculous as this sounds there is a lot of print devoted to trying to prove them guilty google recently started employing artificial intelligence to support its search results that have until now been solely algorithm based but as luck would have it there was a brief period during which time wordpress com took the top position fielding incorrect data on the number of votes earned by clinton and trump and claiming to have obtained the information from twitter the information was reportedly correct elsewhere on google but this was enough to earn google accusations for making money out of fake news so google has said in a statement moving forward we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent misstate or conceal information about the publisher the publisher s content or the primary purpose of the web property it is hoped that the inability to generate revenue from fake news will make it harder to produce it facebook s mark zuckerberg has repeatedly said that of the news sites posting on facebook were authentic and that it didn t want to get into the position of arbiter of truth we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal misleading or deceptive which includes fake news said the facebook statement the company has now added the fake news part to pacify parties facebook also gave an assurance that it would continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance other stories you might have missed corporate intel disney drone show

apple call logs russian provider of iphone hacking tools elcomsoft says that apple maintains a call log of users phone calls and other details in its icloud for up to four months apple likely does this to help sync calls across devices but the storage of private information without explicit consent is problematic moreover in its data access guide for law enforcement apple says that available icloud information includes email logs and content text messages photos documents contacts calendars bookmarks and ios device backups but doesn t mention call logs while all icloud data is encrypted once it s on the server and in transit apple keeps the keys for icloud accounts in its u s data centers amazon nasdaq amzn sues counterfeit sellers following repeated complaints from different parties including apple amazon is taking action against companies acting as counterfeiters last week amazon filed a couple of cases against sellers of training equipment originally developed and patented by fitness anywhere and sold by third parties and against infringers of patented technology for forklift equipment these actions aren t easy because first the patent holder has to be established second new counterfeiters crop up all the time and third amazon given its size has millions of sellers so it s hard to track any one seller so these actions are encouraging amazon s chinese rival alibaba also faces the same problem resulting in the alienation of some brands new technology products apple considering ar device bloomberg reports that apple may be experimenting with a google s glass like ar augmented reality device for which it has spoken to suppliers and ordered a small quantity of related components but while google samsung ks facebook and others have focused more on vr virtual reality apple like microsoft with its hololens seems to be more interested in ar in any event the device is not expected to launch until at the earliest whatsapp video calling facebook has launched fully encrypted free video calling for all whatsapp users across the world while this obviously sweetens personal communications it also makes the app more attractive for business users the recently talked about job posting feature does the same thing facebook had promised to look at monetizing the app once the user base reached critical mass and the company seems to be doing just that amazon family plan similar to apple spotify and others amazon has launched a family plan that charges a month for up to six users prime members aren t getting a concession on this one although they do have the option of choosing an annual family membership for which then brings down the monthly cost to while other music services offer unique experiences feature sets personalized playlists and

driving and other technology connectivity communication context awareness deep learning artificial intelligence safety and security for cars all over the world intel has said that it is currently involved in vehicle programs but that number would swell to by its order book is already pretty huge at a billion dollars but this is just the beginning intel and google get closer google and intel are deepening their relationship with the goal of pushing their respective technologies in the cloud while google needs to wrest share versus amazon and microsoft intel would like to make inroads into the deep learning segment that nvidia dominates the two companies have now decided to go for both product integration and joint marketing to push these efforts especially among big cloud customers they have announced that the collaboration will include container management machine learning iot and security microsoft nvidia tie for a i the companies have announced a collaborative effort to promote microsoft s a i solution through its azure cloud computing platform the microsoft solution is based on gpus from nvidia the leading provider in the machine learning space indicating the considerable prospects the companies say that a i has application across a broad number of industries including healthcare life sciences energy financial services and automotive microsoft ties with elon musk a i company tesla s elon musk has agreed to use microsoft s azure to develop ai technology for its self driving cars the musk backed startup openai will use nvidia powered azure n series virtual machines which will be available from december openai was formed in december last year by musk and y combinator president sam altman and others with the goal of ascertaining that self driving technology remains open and free for all possibly also as a reaction to google s dominance in smartphones amazon hyundai hyundai s connected car blue link technology is now getting alexa integration so users can get their cars warmed up and ready before they step into them or they can ask alexa to lock the doors as they carry heavy grocery bags into the house google amd google is one company that keeps all its options open so on the one hand it uses gpus from nvidia the current market leader by far on the other it is now using nvidia rival amd s gpus and if that isn t enough it s also into

western digital nasdaq wdc making peace with toshiba were the top news from last week here are the details apple buys shazam apple has acquired popular music discovery app shazam for an estimated million shazam identifies music playing near the device within a few seconds and directs users to places like apple s app store or google s play store where they can listen to the whole track later but despite the billion times the app has been downloaded the company hasn t been able to monetize its service well which is probably why it is going this cheap it has raised a total of million in funding rounds the latest of which back in valued the company at billion in it generated around million in revenue to net a pre tax loss of million apple may be expected to integrate the software into apple music or siri or in homepod its new high end smart speaker boasting superior sound quality that will launch in it s unlikely that the service will be available to android users as well as it is now apple offers million to finisar finisar has obtained a million funding from cupertino based apple that it will use to re open a long shuttered sqare foot manufacturing plant in sherman texas the plant will be used to manufacture vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsels a special kind of semiconductor found in sensors enabling mapping of the external environment it therefore has very wide ranging application in things like augmented reality ar and self driving cars it also enables apple s face id technology that s part of its iphone x finisar has said that apple s contribution which comes from a billion dollar fund it set aside for u s manufacturing support is not in the nature of a debt or equity investment but instead represents anticipated future business between the companies over a period of time vcsel products are currently in short supply with the main providers being finisar lumentum and oclaro where oclaro is the smallest and lumentum the leader but finisar has been gearing up to increase production manifold it s unclear at this stage whether apple s agreement with finisar involves the purchase of its entire production which would preclude the company from supplying to android manufacturers like samsung ks etc thus giving apple a competitive edge but apple no doubt secured the deal at very favorable rates as it usually does with its component suppliers so it looks like a good deal for apple and an average one for finisar because apple supply agreements usually mean good volumes at very low profit margins toshiba wdc are friends again toshiba and western digital have agreed to settle all disputes between them which means western digital s withdrawal of all its legal proceedings against toshiba and allowing the sale of toshiba s memory chip business to k k pangea a special purpose acquisition company formed and controlled by a consortium led by bain and including apple and wdc competitors seagate and hynix at the same time they agreed on mutual protections for their assets and confidential information in connection with the sale of toshiba memory and on collaborating to ensure the future success of toshiba memory as a public company following an eventual ipo wdc ceo steve milligan expressed satisfaction that our interests in the jv were sufficiently protected and we had the right kind of protections and the right kind of access they also agreed to extend their jv partnerships including flash alliance that now runs to december and flash forward to december flash partners was previously extended to december additionally neither party will move ahead with the yokkaichi fab fab without the other i e both will invest in the next generation of flash memory bics flash and western digital will receive chip supply they will also collaborate on the upcoming wafer fabrication facility in iwate japan for which a new agreement will be drawn up in due course other stories corporate chinese phone makers coming to the u s bloomberg reports that china s biggest smartphone vendors huawei and xiaomi have their eyes on the u s market while huawei already sells its mate through amazon nasdaq amzn and other ecommerce channels it will be much easier to increase sales with stores carrier partnerships and commercials so the thinking goes xiaomi is looking for a more gradual launch first building its stores to sell fitness trackers thermostats and vacuum cleaners while it works on phone details with carriers at t nyse t verizon and sprint that could take up to two years according to xiaomi executive wang

lab in china alphabet s nasdaq googl google is setting up an artificial intelligence ai research team in beijing china to make the most of the growing talent in the region the company hasn t made much progress doing business in china but chairman eric schmidt has said it never left china the beijing based team will work with ai colleagues in google offices across the world including new york toronto london and zurich it s true that competition for ai talent is on the rise since most modern systems will soon be using some form of the technology so it might be a good idea to grab whatever s

microsoft nasdaq msft and google have reportedly raised objections to a takeover of qualcomm nasdaq qcom by broadcom nasdaq avgo they have said that broadcom has a history of cutting cost rather than investing in innovation that could hurt their own expansion plans microsoft is currently working on arm based windows pcs that could for the first time help it diversify away from the architecture any scale back from qualcomm s side could impact this strategy most of google s android devices use qualcomm chips so it could also be affected by the deal the other reason is that broadcom is cozy with prime competitor apple which could make matters worse for them regulators often collect feedback from the industry to better understand the situation before a deal is approved so this objection could get in the way but qualcomm has reportedly asked companies to shelve public statements to see if broadcom raises the offer significantly from the current a share if that isn t forthcoming there could be more press and publicity on the matter seagate job cuts seagate has announced yet another job cut as it continues to struggle against the onslaught of flash memory technology that continues to eat into the hdd market that it has dominated for years along with western digital but while wdc bought leading flash player sandisk to mitigate its risk seagate focused on hdd customers in the enterprise while cutting costs that strategy hasn t gone so well the current plan is to slash jobs by june to save some million in annualized operating costs a fraction of the couple of billion it spends annually legal regulatory apple opposes india s import tax on mobile parts india wants to increase domestic manufacturing of smartphone components which is not an easy task since of the billion market is imported according to counterpoint research at the end of the day it doesn t help to welcome foreign investment in a way that the domestic manufacturing base isn t strengthened for this purpose the government has a phased manufacturing program pmp that seeks to increase taxes on a growing number of smartphone components to force domestic production apple has held that such imports are necessary at least at the start if its indian operations are to do well and compete effectively so it has asked the government to waive the requirement the government has stated publicly that it is considering apple s demand although the it department has also said that waiving of the pmp may not be feasible in any case people familiar with the matter told reuters that such special treatment isn t forthcoming and that apple is coming round facebook changes revenue booking in eu facebook nasdaq fb has said that its local operations in each of the eu member nations will start booking revenue and profits locally rather than through its eu headquarters at dublin the move should please regulators since it will generate revenues for the country in which the business was transacted and settle disputes that have dragged companies like google and apple through courtroom after courtroom as they tried to justify the negligible taxes they paid in the eu through complicated tax avoidance

after google pulled youtube from amazon devices the leading online retailer has said that it will start selling google chromecast and apple tv on its online store amazon earlier said that it wouldn t

some time because when it acquired whatsapp facebook was in the process of moving instagram in house facebook also reportedly takes time with these things possibly to ensure that the transition is smooth this isn t necessarily a negative for ibm cloud services because it was an inevitable thing but it is something of a blow for its infrastructure services revenue as the market is very competitive with amazon microsoft and google notably whatsapp wasn t a top five customer for ibm toshiba issues second warning letter to western digital there are some interesting developments on this

levandowski who spirited off waymo files initially started out with a self driving trucking company that was then acquired by uber waymo s initial tests are being done on a company owned track in california and will be followed up with rigs test vehicles will reportedly be on the road in arizona later this year the excitement with trucks is probably related to the dynamics of the trucking market where there is currently a shortage of drivers but trucking is also trickier in the sense that there are some additional jobs required such as gas filling and ice cutting that may require

impacting stocks and the financial markets stocks recently featured in the blog include intel nasdaq intc advanced micro devices nasdaq amd alphabet nasdaq googl taiwan semiconductor nyse tsm and nvidia nasdaq nvda here are highlights from thursday s analyst blog the intel amd showdownit s beginning to look like a really interesting market after years of essentially one player taking all the spoils we now have a significant second that has the technology to make a difference the incumbent is of course intel which just apologized to customers for continued supply constraints despite double digit growth in supply from the first half to the second while maintaining its raised guidance fourth quarter revenue of billion and eps of and full year revenue of billion and eps of unanticipated increase in pc demand is not the only issue however intel is also trying to maintain production while ramping up it s building out capacity and one might argue why this wasn t done before while there were all the product delays but supply demand parity hasn t been achieved yet and management hasn t said anything about when it will be so that s that on the other side we have challenger advanced micro devices which is announcing one breakthrough device after another significant partnerships with companies like alphabet s google and amazon nasdaq amzn and manufacturing alliances with leading edge foundry taiwan semiconductor which is making its chips it s true that nvidia is also a player but it doesn t have at the core and is instead focused on gpus and the largescale parallel processing they enable this is making waves at hpc and the data center in general especially after the mellanox acquisition but nvidia doesn t play in all the categories like pcs mobile computing and data center the way amd does so intel and amd are the main rivals just for perspective let s see what the two companies brought in last quarter intel generated billion in revenue and in eps up million and cents a share respectively or more or less level with year ago revenue and eps in percentage terms amd brought in billion in revenue and in eps up million and cents a share respectively from last year so amd s revenue and per share earnings are about of intel s making it almost like a david goliath situation moreover intel has billion on its balance sheet while amd has a mere billion amd also generates a small fraction of the cash flow that intel does the difference in financial position between the two companies despite the fact that amd is growing much faster means that intel has significant resources to go into a very aggressive price war that amd will find it harder to sustain this can especially hurt the company as it preps to target mid and high range segments especially in mobile computing intel will no doubt adopt this strategy as its design teams have fallen behind and semiconductor designs take years to develop which is followed by qualifying the production process ramping production and bringing to market intel being the foundry for its own chips has the added difficulty that it doesn t rely on expertise that s already available it may however do this if necessary intel s management team is also not what it used to be given these difficulties and the fact that current management has admitted to a likelihood of share losses to amd all the traditional intel partners have their plan b which is amd so they have at least some amd powered models and systems but what about the valuation at forward twelve months earnings intc shares are trading in a tight range but below its median value over the past year they re also trading below the s p s so intel shares are undervalued amd on the other hand is trading at which is close to the high end of the range over the past year so it s obviously overvalued that would be unless it consistently beats estimates over the next year by a significant margin so for comparison let s take a look at its surprise history the company has met estimated earnings in each of the last two quarters it beat by in the quarter prior to that and missed by before that averaging a gain in the last four quarters this doesn t look too significant if amd doesn t significantly top expectations in the next year the current valuation looks untenable that s why we have a zacks rank hold on amd shares and a zacks rank buy on

chips and both of these companies compete with intel in the ever important gaming segment but have nvidia and amd done enough to put a dent in intel s upcoming earnings report well one approach to answering this question is to focus on intel s core business segments luckily by using our exclusive non financial metrics estimates file we can gauge analyst sentiment and predict the company s performance in its key units these important stock driving estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts because of nvidia and amd s popularity in the gaming market we might expect to see an impact in intel s client computing group this business segment includes the company s products designed for notebooks and desktops so it could certainly feel the effects of these gaming friendly chipmakers according to our latest consensus estimates the client computing group is expected to post revenues of billion which would represent a slump of about from the billion posted in the year ago period still while this dip could imply that intel is losing some market share in the personal computing space the company has made some strides in this area recently for example intel recently launched its eighth generation core processors which should lift the company s gaming endeavors and on top of this the client computing group has been a surprise performer for intel this year in fact in the second quarter intel posted revenues of billion in this unit that results smashed our consensus estimate of billion and marked year over year growth of nearly heading into its report intel is sporting a zacks rank strong buy the stock also has a positive earnings esp of so we can feel more confident about the company s chance at an earnings beat intel shares are sitting near their week but if the company can outperform again especially in key categories like client computing the stock might just break into a new range also read make sure to

the zacks equity research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets stocks recently featured in the blog include texas instruments nasdaq txn intel nasdaq intc micro devices nasdaq amd tsmc nyse tsm and nvidia nasdaq nvda here are highlights from wednesday s analyst blog intel intc earnings on thursday will it prove analysts wrong earnings season is underway and semiconductor stocks are up to bat texas instruments looks to have struck out in its disappointing after the bell on tuesday missing on the topline and substantially lowering guidance txn is down over in this morning s trade causing the broader semi category to open lower intel the largest semiconductor company in the us is preparing to release its september quarter earnings thursday october after the bell zacks consensus estimates are showing an eps of on revenues of billion which would represent a decline in both eps and revenues intel is a relatively big mover on earnings and recently that has been to the downside this stock has rallied into and earnings only to fall in the month following the results keep that in mind in anticipation of this upcoming report intel has beaten eps estimates for every quarter since and rarely do they miss revenue it appears the largest driver for this company on earnings reports is forward guidance due to the significant cyclicality in the semiconductor space cpu battlethe fight for cpu market share is flaring between semiconductor powerhouses intel and advanced micro devices intel has been the industry leader in pc and server cpus for years but recent execution issues have allowed amd to come in and swooped up the free market share if you are a big pc gamer or computer whiz i am sure you are more than familiar with the differences between intel and amd chips and likely have an opinion on the quality price mix for the laymen a cpu stands for a central processing unit and is effectively the brain of a computer server this technology is continuously advancing with the year old moore s law still being relevant today gordon moore one of the co founders of intel stated that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every years while the cost is cut in half which means that computers will continue to become exponentially faster and more efficient while at the same time cheaper moore s law still holds today the number of transistors on a microchip depends on the size of the transistor nodes which halve every few years amd has started shipping node cpus while intel is struggling to unveil its chips which have experienced excessive delays intel originally intended to ship its chips back in but had issues on its node chips an atom is to nanometers nm to put into perspective the atomic level in which this is measured intel s recent production issues and delays in next generation cpus have allowed amd to pounce and take a substantial amount of market share intel had been dominating the cpu market for years but recent events have allowed amd to take market share with their ability to not only create the highest performing cpu but at a lower price point currently intel controls of the cpu market while amd has been able to take a share from the less than it controlled a couple of years ago intel doesn t work with the world s foundry tsmc for its cpu innovation and production which is setting them behind the curve tsmc is partnered with amd to surpass the cpu giant and they seem to have a competitive advantage tsmc is in the process of developing transistor chips which will be in production by next year intel says it will have chips by and now this timeline may be pushed back intel may be forced to work with tsmc to remain competitive in the cpu space shift to data centricintel is in the midst of a transformation from a pc centric company to a data centric one nearly half of their growing revenue is now being driven by data centric revenue streams which expanded this past fiscal year intel s total accessible market tam grew to more than billion through acquisitions and product innovations the business is committed to continue investing and developing their cloud computing ai analytics along with the rest of their portfolio the pc business remains intel s biggest topline driver but this business is both mature and overly competitive intel is going to have to rely on its data centric businesses for growth moving forward the data centric business is facing competition for the increasingly powerful gpu which nvidia has proven to be effective in data centers gpu s speed and functionality are slowly surpassing that of cpu s but today they work together to create the most propitious computer power take awayintel is falling behind the curve and it appears this may be a trend moving forward as its competitors broaden their competitive moat intel is still a force to be reckoned with in the cpu market but it will continue to lose market share if it is not able to step its innovative game intel analysts aren t anticipating growth in thursday s quarterly report if the company is able to prove them wrong then intc could see a substantial upside i wouldn t recommend
